total number of tropical cyclones by the 2005 season which broke the record with 28 storms tropical cyclones that did not approach populated areas or shipping lanes especially if they were relatively weak and of short duration may have remained undetected because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable compensating for the lack of comprehensive observation one hurricane researcher estimates the season could have produced 24 tropical cyclones 1 of the 20 storms during the season 11
