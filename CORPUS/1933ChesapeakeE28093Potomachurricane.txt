interpolation of reports it is estimated the storm intensified into a hurricane on august 16 while halfway between africa and the lesser antilles 4 the weather bureau began tracking the system on august 18. 5 later that day a ship reported a pressure of 948 mbar 28.0 inhg  suggesting winds of 135 mph 215 km h  this made the hurricane a category 4 on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale another ship report on august 20 indicated a pressure of 940 mbar 28 inhg while reporting hurricane winds suggesting peak winds of 140 mph 230 km h  4 after remaining near peak intensity for three days the hurricane began steadily weakening while curving more to the west-northwest 4 a rare track for the region due to steering from a ridge over new england 6 on august 21, the storm passed about
