season was the final season of the eastern north pacific s most recent active string of hurricane seasons that unofficially started in 1981. the season officially started on may 15, 1994, in the eastern pacific and on june 1, 1994, in the central pacific and lasted until november 30, 1994. these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern pacific ocean the first tropical cyclone formed on june 18, while the last system dissipated on october 26. 1 this season twenty-two tropical cyclones formed in the north pacific ocean east of the dateline with all but two becoming tropical storms or hurricanes a total of 10 hurricanes occurred including five major hurricanes of note in this season is an unusual spree of very intense storms hurricanes emilia gilma john and olivia all reached a pressure below 930 millibars longevity-wise no tropical cyclone of any basin had previously persisted for as long as hurricane john which lasted 31 days elsewhere hurricane rosa caused four casualties in mexico as the basin s lone landfalling tropical storm or hurricane and later was responsible for flooding in texas season

twenty-two tropical cyclones formed in the north pacific ocean east of the dateline all but two of them became tropical storms or hurricanes in the eastern pacific region 140°w to north america  nineteen tropical depressions formed of which seventeen became tropical storms nine further intensifying into hurricanes and five ultimately reaching major hurricanes of category 3 intensity or higher on the saffir simpson scale 1 these numbers are slightly above the long-term averages of fifteen tropical storms nine hurricanes and four major hurricanes 2 in the central pacific hurricane center s area of responsibility 140°w to the international date line  three depressions two tropical storms and one hurricane formed overall there were eleven tropical cyclones eight tropical storms five hurricanes and three major hurricanes that formed or entered the central pacific region 3 these numbers are well above the long-term average of four tropical cyclones two hurricanes one tropical storm and two depressions 4 the exceptionally high activity was contributed to by an el niño ongoing at the time 5 the only named storm to make landfall this year was hurricane rosa 1 which killed four people in western mexico 6 and forced over 400 to be evacuated 7 other notable storms include hurricane olivia a high-end category 4 system 1 the three category 5 hurricanes emilia gilma and john both john and hurricane li existed in two of the three basins east and west of the pacific ocean 8 this season marked the end of the northeastern pacific s most recent active period which began in 1982, 9 and includes the five most active pacific hurricane seasons 1 9 beginning in 1995, multi-decadal factors switched to a phase that suppresses pacific hurricane activity 10 since then pacific hurricane seasons have generally been below normal 11 the lone abnormally active season since then was in 1997, where a strong el nino event was observed 9 the 1994 pacific hurricane season set several records first three hurricanes reached category 5 intensity on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale 8 setting a record later tied in 2002. 1 hurricane john lasted longer and spent more time tropical than any other tropical cyclone on earth in recorded history 12 eleven tropical cyclones entered or formed in the central pacific a record shared with the 1992 season until the 2015 season broke the record 5 finally of the four most intense hurricanes recorded in the central pacific three of them occurred this season 3 the season began with the formation of tropical depression one-e on june 18 and ended with the dissipation of tropical depression nona on october 26. 1 no named systems formed in may three in june four in july five in august six in september two in october and none in november 1 the

windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force winds every six hours summing the results and dividing that total by 104. as a tropical cyclone does not have gale-force winds until it becomes a tropical storm tropical depressions are not included in these tables for all storms ace is given to three significant figures the ace in the east pacific proper 140°w to north america is given the ace in the central pacific the international date line to 140°w is given in brackets the table includes the ace for li and john only during those storm s time east of the dateline their ace west of the dateline is part of the totals of the 1994 typhoon season the national hurricane center uses ace to rank hurricane seasons as above-normal near-normal and below-normal it defines below-normal as having an ace less than 95 104 kt2 kt2 it defines above normal as having an ace above 150 104 kt2 along with the numbers of any two of the following above average tropical storms 15  hurricanes 9  or major hurricanes 4 it defines near-normal as having an ace between 100 104 kt2 and 150 104 kt2 or an ace above 150 104 kt2 with fewer than two of the numbers of the following above average tropical storms 15  hurricanes 9  or major hurricanes 4  2 this season has a total of seventeen tropical storms nine hurricanes and five major hurricanes the total ace of this season is 185

disorganized with multiple centers of circulation 32 and advisories were discontinued on august 5. the depression s remains continued their westward path well south of the hawaiian islands the depression regenerated on august 8. it soon strengthened into a tropical storm and was named li 8 which is hawaiian for lee  33 li approached the dateline on its generally westward heading just before crossing it intensified into a minimal category 1 hurricane it crossed the dateline on august 12 and became a storm in the 1994 pacific typhoon season 8 wind shear from a tropical upper-tropospheric trough weakened back into a tropical storm as it crossed the dateline and the joint typhoon warning center downgraded li with its first advisory 34 li stayed a tropical storm until august 16, where it
