atlantic hurricane season was an active atlantic hurricane season with tropical activity before and after the official bounds of the season – the first such occurrence in 49 years the season produced 21 tropical cyclones of which 16 developed into named storms seven cyclones attained hurricane status of which three reached major hurricane status with sixteen storms the season was tied for the sixth most active atlantic hurricane season on record the strongest hurricane of the season was hurricane isabel which reached category 5 status on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale northeast of the lesser antilles isabel later struck north carolina as a category 2 hurricane causing 3.6 billion in damage 2003 usd 4.69 billion 2017 usd and a total of 51 deaths across the mid-atlantic region of the united states the season began with subtropical storm ana on april 20, prior to the official start of the season the bounds of the season are from june 1 to november 30, which conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the atlantic basin in early september hurricane fabian struck bermuda as a category 3 hurricane where it was the worst hurricane since 1926 on the island it caused four deaths and 300 million in damage 2003 usd 391 million 2017 usd  hurricane juan caused considerable destruction to nova scotia particularly halifax as a category 2

issued a 55 probability of above normal activity the forecasters predicted 11–15 tropical storms 6–9 of those becoming hurricanes and 2–4 of those hurricanes reaching at least category 3 strength on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale the above normal activity predicted was due to the likelihood of la niña developing in the season 2 noted hurricane expert dr william m gray on april 4 predicted twelve named storms with eight reaching hurricane strength and three of the eight reaching category 3 strength 3 the prediction issued on may 30 was similar increasing the named storms to fourteen the synoptic pattern of the season prior to june 1 resembled other previous seasons with the 1952, 1954, 1964, 1966, and 1998 seasons considered the best analogs for the season the prediction also included a 68 probability for a hurricane landfall along the united states 4 mid-season outlook edit on august 6, dr gray announced he had maintained his previous prediction with an active start of the season the rest of the season was forecast to have been only slightly above average due to an anticipated overall less favorable environment across the atlantic ocean 5 a day later noaa released an updated prediction as well with a 60 probability of above normal activity with 12–15 named storms 7–9 hurricanes and 3–4 major hurricanes expected 6 a normal season as defined by noaa has 6–14

beginning of the season was on june 1, 2003, 8 though subtropical storm ana formed on april 20, well before the start to the season 9 starting at the official start of the season the national hurricane center began issuing five-day forecasts extending from the three-day forecasts issued since 1964. officials conducted tests during the previous two seasons indicating the new five-day forecasts would be as accurate as the three-day forecasts were 15 years earlier 10 the tropics were active and well ahead of climatology in the early portion of the season with the seventh tropical depression forming by the end of july 11 the season officially ended on november 30, 2003, 8 although tropical storms odette and peter developed in early december 12 13 the season is one of only six with a storm before and after the official bounds of the season the others are 1887, 1951, 1953, 1954 and 2007. when tropical storm peter formed on december 7, the season became the second on record with two december storms the 235 days between the development of the first storm tropical storm ana and the dissipation of the last storm peter made the 2003 season the longest season since 1952. the season was the eighth most active on record behind the 2005, 1933, 2012, 2011, 2010, 1995, 1887, and 1969 seasons and tied with the 1936 and 2008 seasons 14 no cyclones in the season had a significant impact on south america or central america however a total of eight tropical cyclones made landfall on mexico from either the atlantic or the pacific ocean which was the greatest total since the record of nine in 1971. a total of seven deaths occurred in mexico from atlantic hurricanes much of the caribbean did not receive significant impact from tropical cyclones during the season 15 damage from hurricane fabian on bermuda six tropical cyclones made landfall along the coast of the united states during the season including two hurricanes the first claudette caused locally heavy damage in southeastern texas in july two deaths were reported in the state while earlier in its duration it caused an indirect death from rough waves in florida 16 in september hurricane isabel caused deaths and damage from north carolina through southern canada 17 the worst damage from the hurricane occurred in virginia where it was the costliest disaster in the history of the state 18 there damage totaled 1.85 billion 2003 usd 2.41 billion 2017 usd  and there were 32 fatalities ten of which were caused directly by the hurricane 17 hurricane isabel caused deaths in seven states and one canadian province and about 6 million people were left without power as a result of the storm 19 several cyclones impacted bermuda during the season most significantly hurricane fabian on the island its passage proved to be the costliest and resulted in the first death since a hurricane in 1926. 20 the hurricane killed four on the island when its strong waves and storm surge washed two cars off the causeway between st george s parish and st david s island 21 damage from the hurricane totaled 300 million 2003 usd 391 million 2017 usd  22 elsewhere hurricane juan was considered among the most damaging in the history of halifax nova scotia where strong winds downed thousands of trees and left low-lying areas flooded from a record storm surge to the city the hurricane caused a total of eight

ana on april 20 to the west of bermuda it tracked east-southeastward and organized and on april 21 it transitioned into a tropical cyclone with peak winds of 60 mph 95 km h  after developing an upper-level warm core increased wind shear caused fluctuations in intensity and a steady weakening trend and on april 24 the center of ana merged with an approaching cold front thus signaling the completion of extratropical transition the extratropical remnants continued east-northeastward and on april 27 the gale was absorbed within the cold front 9 the cyclone is most notable for being the only atlantic tropical cyclone in the month of april until tropical storm arlene in 2017. when ana became a subtropical storm it became the second subtropical cyclone on record in the month after a storm in 1992. 9 ana dropped 2.63 in 67 mm of rainfall in bermuda over a period of several days 24 increased swells from the storm caused two drowning deaths in southeastern florida when a boat

increased further on june 10, and the system was declared tropical depression two early on june 11 in the central tropical atlantic ocean 26 29 the depression was at the time the third tropical cyclone on record to develop in the month of june to the east of the lesser antilles 30 the others were tropical depression two in 2000, 31 ana in 1979, and a storm in 1933. 30 the next such system to accomplish this would be bret in 2017. initially the depression was forecast to attain tropical storm status maintaining good outflow and some banding features around the system 29 around 0900 utc on june 11 satellite-based intensity estimates indicated the depression was near tropical storm status 32 however the convection subsequently diminished and became displaced to the northeast of the center and late on june 11 the depression degenerated into an open tropical wave about 950 mi 1535 km east-southeast of barbados 26 the tropical wave remained well-defined with a well-defined

louisiana bill quickly weakened over land and as it accelerated to the northeast moisture from the storm combined with cold air from an approaching cold front produced an outbreak of 34 tornadoes bill became extratropical on july 2, and was absorbed by the cold front later that day 35 upon making landfall on louisiana the storm produced a moderate storm surge causing tidal flooding 36 in a city in the northeastern portion of the state the surge breached a levee which flooded many homes in the town 37 moderate winds combined with wet soil knocked down trees which then hit a few houses and power lines 38 and left hundreds of thousands without electric power 39 further inland tornadoes from the storm produced localized moderate damage throughout its path tropical storm bill caused around 50

attaining hurricane status briefly on july 10 before weakening and hitting puerto morelos on the yucatán peninsula on july 11 as a tropical storm the storm remained disorganized due to moderate wind shear though after turning west-northwestward into an area of lighter shear it re-attained hurricane status on july 15 off the coast of texas it intensified quickly and made landfall on matagorda island with peak winds of 90 mph 145 km h  it slowly weakened after moving ashore tracking across northern tamaulipas before dissipating in northwestern chihuahua 16 the precursor cyclone caused light damage in the lesser antilles and waves from the hurricane caused an indirect death off of florida 16 widespread flooding and gusty winds destroyed or severely damaged 412 buildings in southeast texas

the system slowly organized and after a closed low-level circulation developed the system was classified as tropical depression five about 630 mi 1020 km east of bermuda it quickly organized becoming tropical storm danny a day after forming tracking around the periphery of an anticyclone the storm moved northwestward before turning north and later northeastward despite being located at a high latitude danny continued to strengthen due to unusually warm water temperatures and on july 19 it attained hurricane status about 525 mi 850 km south of st john s newfoundland and labrador despite having an unusually high minimum pressure for a storm of its intensity 41 wind shear increased the next day as the hurricane turned eastward causing a steady weakening trend that was accelerated after crossing into an area of cooler water temperatures by july 20 the cyclone had turned to the southeast and weakened to tropical depression status and on july 21 it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area the remnants of danny tracked erratically southwestward before dissipating on july 27 about 630 mi 1015 km east of where it originally developed there were no reports of damages or

the national hurricane center classified it as tropical depression six while it was located about 1035 mi 1675 km east of the lesser antilles 42 upon being classified as a tropical cyclone the depression maintained two ill-defined hooking bands to its north and south and was originally forecast to attain hurricane status before passing through the lesser antilles with warm waters and very light wind shear forecast its environmental conditions met four out of five parameters for rapid intensification 44 subsequently convection diminished as the result of cold air inflow and instability from a disturbance to its southeast 45 with a fast forward speed confirmation of a low-level circulation on july 20 became difficult 46 convection increased in curvature on july 21, 47 and several islands in the lesser antilles issued tropical storm warnings and watches after it passed north of barbados a hurricane hunters flight failed to report a closed low-level circulation and it is estimated the depression degenerated into an open tropical wave late on july 21. the remnants brought a few showers to the lesser antilles 42 and after tracking into the caribbean sea redevelopment was prevented by increased wind shear 48 the northern portion of the wave axis split and developed into tropical depression seven 42 tropical depression seven edit tropical depression sshws duration

depression seven at 1200 utc on july 25 about 60 mi 95 km east of daytona beach florida the system was embedded in an environment characterized by high surface pressures tracking through an area of cool water temperatures 49 as well as unfavorable upper-level winds the depression failed to achieve winds greater than 35 mph 55 km h  50 early on july 26 it moved ashore on st catherines island georgia and after steadily weakening over land it dissipated on july 27. as the storm was never forecast to attain tropical storm status no tropical storm warnings or watches were issued 49 however flood watches were posted for much of georgia and south carolina 51 the depression dropped light to moderate rainfall from florida to the coast of north carolina peaking at 5.17 in 131 mm in savannah

non-tropical low on august 9 about 1150 mi 1860 km east of bermuda it tracked quickly southwestward then westward in tandem with an upper-level low which prevented tropical development on august 13 an area of convection increased as it passed through the bahamas and while crossing florida a circulation built toward the surface it is estimated the system developed into tropical storm erika on august 14 about 85 mi 140 km west-southwest of fort myers florida a strong ridge caused the storm to continue quickly westward and the system gradually strengthened and organized by august 15 its forward motion slowed allowing the convection to organize into curved rainbands and late in the day an eye feature began developing tropical storm erika attained hurricane status at around 1030 utc as it was moving ashore in northeastern tamaulipas operationally it was not classified as a hurricane due to lack of data the winds rapidly decreased as it tracked across the mountainous terrain of northeastern mexico and early on august 17 the cyclone dissipated 53 the hurricane dropped light to moderate rainfall along its path which caused some flooding in montemorelos in nuevo león two people died after

forecasters predicted the depression to intensify to a strong tropical storm 56 however strong southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly became established over the system and the depression degenerated into a tropical wave late on august 22 to the south of the eastern tip of the dominican republic 54 the remnants of the depression dropped light to moderate precipitation in the dominican republic which caused flooding and overflown rivers more than 100 houses were flooded and some crop damage was reported 15 the rainfall was welcome in the country as conditions were dry in the preceding months
