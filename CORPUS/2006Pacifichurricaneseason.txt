2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 the 2006 pacific hurricane season was the most active since 2000, producing 19 tropical storms or hurricanes 1 eighteen developed within the national hurricane center nhc area of warning responsibility which is east of 140°w and one storm formed between 140°w and the international date line which is under the jurisdiction of the central pacific hurricane center cphc  of the 19 total storms eleven became hurricanes of which six attained major hurricane status within the nhc portion of the basin the season officially began on may 15, and in the cphc portion it started on june 1 the season officially ended on november 30. these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the eastern pacific basin the strongest storm of the season was hurricane ioke which reached category 5 status on the saffir-simpson scale in the central pacific ocean ioke passed near johnston atoll and later wake island where it caused heavy damage but no deaths the deadliest storm of the season was hurricane john which killed six people after striking the baja california peninsula and the costliest storm was hurricane lane which caused 203 million in damage in southwestern mexico 2006 usd 241 million 2017 usd  seasonal activity began on may 27, when tropical storm aletta formed off the southwest coast of mexico no storms formed in june though the season became active in july when five named storms developed including hurricane daniel which was the second strongest storm of the season as well as tropical storm emilia during august hurricanes ioke and john formed as well as four other storms september was a relatively quiet month with two storms of which one was hurricane lane three storms developed in october including hurricane paul and two formed in november this marked the second time on record after 1961, when more than one tropical storm developed in the basin during the month of november seasonal

pacific season was expected to be hindered by the decades-long cycle that began in 1995, which generally increased wind shear across the basin noaa predicted a below-normal level of activity in the eastern pacific with 12–16 named storms of which 6–8 were expected to become hurricanes and 1–3 expected to become major hurricanes 3 the central pacific hurricane center s area of responsibility was also expected to be below average with only two to three tropical cyclones expected to form or cross into the area 4 they expected that neither el niño nor la niña would affect conditions significantly 3 on may 15, the hurricane season began in the eastern pacific basin which is the area of the northern pacific ocean east of 140°w 5 on june 1, the season began in the central pacific warning zone between 140°w and the international dateline however no storms occurred in the region until july 6 seasonal summary edit main article timeline of the 2006 pacific hurricane season no tropical storms developed in june in the basin which was unusual compared to the average of two storms forming during the month since 1966, there have been only three other seasons in which a tropical storm did not form in june these being 1969, 2004, and 2007. 7 after such an inactive month the tropics became active in july when five named storms developed including hurricane daniel which was the second strongest storm of the season during august hurricanes ioke and john formed as well as four other storms september was a relatively quiet month with two storms of which one was hurricane lane 8 by that time however el niño conditions became established across the pacific 9 which is known to enhance pacific hurricane activity 3 three storms developed in october including hurricane paul 8 tropical activity within the basin in november 2006 was the most active on record based on the accumulated cyclone energy ace index three tropical cyclones formed of which two became tropical storms only two other seasons on record 1961 and 2015, produced two tropical storms in the month of november 10 in addition mexico was struck by four tropical cyclones in 2006, none on the atlantic coast and all along the pacific coast 11 one hit baja california peninsula while the others made landfall on the mainland 12 an extratropical storm persisted in the extreme northern central pacific ocean in late october it drifted over unusually warm waters up to 3.6 °f 2 °c above normal and gradually developed convection near the center by november 2, quikscat satellite suggested the system attained winds of up to 60 mph 95 km h about 900 mi 1450 km west of oregon the system also developed an eye and an eyewall the cyclone tracked northeastward as it gradually weakened and dissipated on november 4. nasa considered the cyclone to be a subtropical storm however as it formed outside of the territory of any monitoring organization it was not named operationally the united states navy treated the system as a tropical disturbance numbered 91c 13 systems edit tropical storm aletta edit tropical storm sshws duration may 27 – may 30 peak intensity 45 mph 75 km h 1-min 1002 mbar hpa main article

coast in southwestern mexico prompting the mexican government to issue tropical storm watches between punta maldonado and zihuatanejo 16 aletta then became stationary over the guerrero and oaxaca coastlines but it later turned to the west and dissipated on may 30. 14 aletta produced moderate rainfall across mexico including a 24-hour rainfall total of 3.94 inches 100 mm nb 1 in jacatepec

the southwest mexican coast high shear slowed the development of the system although it gained enough convection and organization to be classified as a tropical depression on june 3. the depression strengthened to near tropical storm status as it approached the coast of southwestern mexico however shear persisted over the system and it weakened before dissipating on june 4. 17 despite never becoming a named storm heavy rain occurred including a total of 19.13 inches 486 mm measured in a 48‑hour period in acapulco 18 mudslides and flash flooding were reported 17 forcing 72 people from

duration quickly intensifying into a tropical storm and hurricane a clear well-defined eye developed and bud became the first major hurricane of the season on july 13, the hurricane attained peak winds of 125 mph 205 km h  although cooler waters and stable air caused a marked weakening trend by july 15, bud weakened to tropical depression status and the next day it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area 20 the remnants of bud produced light rainfall across hawaii 21 hurricane carlotta edit category 1 hurricane sshws duration july 12 – july 16 peak intensity 85 mph 140 km h 1-min 981 mbar hpa a tropical wave exited africa on june 30 and moved across the atlantic ocean without development on july 9, while crossing central america into the eastern north pacific ocean thunderstorm activity increased and the system organized into tropical depression four-e early on july 12 about 290 mi 465 km south of zihuatanejo guerrero 22 the large depression moved quickly to the west-northwest to the south of a ridge over northwestern mexico and its outer rainbands moved across the coast rainfall totals were less than 1 inch 25 mm  22 the depression intensified into tropical storm carlotta just six hours after forming 22 by late on july 12, the storm developed banding features 23 and early on july 13 carlotta attained hurricane status about 430 mi 700 km south of the southern tip of the baja california peninsula 22 as carlotta intensified the system became more compact and it reached peak winds of 85 mph 140 km h on july 13. 22 an eye formed in the center and the hurricane was briefly forecast to attain major hurricane status or a category 3 on the saffir-simpson scale 24 however carlotta weakened due to increased wind shear from hurricane bud to its west 22 and the eye and convection deteriorated 25 carlotta briefly weakened to tropical storm status late on july 14, although a decrease in shear allowed it to reintensify into a hurricane this was short-lived as the center moved into the area of cooler waters and carlotta again weakened to tropical storm status 22 late on july 15, the circulation became separated from the convection 26 and carlotta weakened to tropical depression status on july 16, and the next day generated into a remnant low the circulation continued generally westward dissipating on july 20 about 1500 mi 2400 km east

a tropical disturbance formed far to the south of the baja california peninsula and quickly increased in convective activity and organization becoming a tropical depression the system continued to organize and was designated as a tropical storm the next day on july 18, daniel attained hurricane status and two days later underwent rapid intensification it reached major hurricane status and was later upgraded further to category 4 status on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale its peak intensity was 150 mph 240 km h  27 the hurricane underwent eyewall replacement cycles which are internal mechanisms that occur in most intense hurricanes daniel later became an annular hurricane which allowed it to maintain category 4 status for longer than it otherwise would have 28 it crossed over into the central pacific early on july 24 and was predicted to affect hawaii as a tropical storm however daniel encountered weak steering currents in the open ocean causing it to slow down considerably 27 it rapidly degenerated to a tropical depression on july 25, and the cphc issued its last advisory on july 26 while the storm was still well to the east of hawaii its remnants later moved across the hawaiian islands 27 dropping heavy rainfall and causing flooding 9 west wailuaiki on maui recorded 3.87 inches 98 mm in one day which was the highest daily rainfall total from the hurricane 21 tropical storm emilia edit tropical storm sshws duration july 21 – july 28 peak intensity 65 mph 100 km h 1-min 990 mbar hpa main article tropical storm emilia 2006 the origins of emilia were from a tropical wave that developed into a tropical depression on july 21, a short distance off the coast of acapulco it moved generally north-northwestward reaching tropical storm status on july 22 and passing about 175 mi 280 km southwest of manzanillo colima 29 an eyewall began to form that day 30 and emilia reached peak winds of 65 mph 105 km h  29 it briefly weakened due to wind shear although restrengthening occurred as the storm turned toward the baja california peninsula on july 26, emilia again reached peak winds of 65 mph 105 km h  and shortly thereafter it passed about 60 mi 95 km southwest of the southern tip of baja california it weakened as it turned into cooler waters first to tropical depression status on july 27 and then to a convective-less remnant low on july 28. the remnants dissipated on july 31 about 495 mi 800 km west-southwest of san diego california 29 in southwestern mexico emilia produced tropical storm force winds along the coastline rainfall in the southern portion of the baja california peninsula caused minor flooding and gusty winds caused damage to buildings and power lines 29 moisture from emilia reached the southwestern united states thunderstorms and rainfall occurred across arizona causing flooding 31 in southern california the storm dropped light rainfall which assisted firefighters in containing a wildfire 32 tropical storm fabio edit tropical storm sshws duration july 31 – august 3 peak intensity 50 mph 85 km h 1-min 1000 mbar hpa a tropical wave crossed the west coast of africa on july 15 and entered the pacific on july 25. convection increased on july 28, and at 1800 utc on july 31 the system became tropical depression seven-e about 980 miles 1,580 km southwest of the southern tip of the baja california peninsula six hours later the depression was upgraded to tropical storm fabio it moved westward due to a ridge to its north and on august 1 fabio reached peak winds of 50 mph 85 km h  later the storm began weakening due to increased wind shear and dry air on august 3, fabio deteriorated to tropical depression status and later that day it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area the remnants continued westward moving across hawaii on august 7. 33 although fabio did not impact land its remnants produced heavy rainfall in hawaii in a 24-hour period 2.89 inches 73 mm of rainfall was recorded at glenwood on the island of hawaii this was the highest daily rainfall total for the month on the island however the heaviest precipitation fell on mount waiʻaleʻale on kauai where 15.08 inches 383 mm fell in 24 hours this total alone was greater than all other monthly rainfall totals in the state 34 the heavy rainfall flooded the hanalei river which forced the closure of the kuhio highway when a bridge was inundated 33 on oahu the rainfall caused ponding on roadways and flooding along streams one flooded stream stranded 24 hikers along a trail all of whom required rescue by helicopter 35 tropical storm gilma edit tropical storm sshws duration august 1 – august 3 peak intensity 40 mph 65 km h 1-min 1004 mbar hpa on july 17, a tropical wave exited africa and crossed the atlantic without developing on july 25 it entered the eastern pacific gradually developing an area of organized convection despite marginally favorable upper-level winds the system organized enough to be declared a tropical depression on august 1, several hundred miles southwest of acapulco mexico 36 initially the depression tracked west-northwestward 8 despite wind shear in the area 37 the depression was upgraded to tropical storm gilma later on august 1. the wind shear prevented further strengthening or organization and gilma weakened to a tropical depression early on august 2. 36 the depression turned westward 8 and gilma degenerated into a remnant low by august 4. 36 hurricane hector edit category 2 hurricane sshws duration august 15 – august 23 peak intensity 110 mph 175 km h 1-min 966 mbar hpa a tropical wave exited africa on july 31, and after no development in the atlantic it crossed central america into the northeastern pacific ocean on august 10. convection gradually increased and a broad low pressure area developed about 375 miles 605 km south of acapulco mexico on august 13. the system continued to become organized and it developed into a tropical depression around 1800 utc on august 15 about 650 mi 1,045 km south-southwest of the southern tip of baja california it moved west-northwestward located south of a ridge that extended westward from northern mexico westward into the pacific the depression quickly intensified into tropical storm hector early on august 16. 38 hector was able to steadily strengthen reaching hurricane status at 0600 utc on august 17. it is estimated that hector reached its peak intensity of 110 mph 175 km h at 0600 utc on august 18, while centered about 1,035 mi 1,665 km southwest of the southern tip of baja california 8 hector remained a category 2 hurricane for about 24 hours 8 shortly thereafter it encountered cooler waters and westerly shear 39 and hector steadily weakened until becoming a tropical storm by august 20. shortly thereafter the storm reached a weakness in the subtropical ridge which caused it to move slowly to the northwest by august 21, deep convection was confined to the northeast portion of the circulation 40 the shear was not strong enough to completely weaken the tropical cyclone and hector remained a tropical storm with 50 mph 85 km h winds for about 24 hours 38 after the remaining shower and thunderstorm activity dissipated on august 22, the cyclone turned westward in response to the low-level easterly wind flow 41 hector weakened to a tropical depression at 0000 utc on august 23, and to a remnant low six hours later the remnant circulation of hector dissipated on august 24 about 750 mi 1,210 km east of the hawaiian islands 42 hurricane ioke edit category 5 hurricane sshws duration august 20 – august 27 exited basin peak intensity 160 mph 260 km h 1-min 915 mbar hpa main article hurricane ioke the cyclone developed from the intertropical convergence zone on august 20 far to the south of hawaii encountering warm waters little wind shear and well-defined outflow ioke intensified from a tropical depression to category 4 status within 48 hours late on august 22 it rapidly weakened to category 2 status before crossing over johnston atoll two days later favorable conditions again allowed for rapid strengthening and ioke attained category 5 status on august 25 before crossing the international date line at the time its barometric pressure was estimated at 915 mbar thus becoming the strongest hurricane on record in the central pacific 9 as it continued westward its intensity fluctuated and on august 31 it passed near wake island with winds of 155 mph 249 km h  ioke gradually weakened as it turned northwestward and northward and by september 6 it had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone 43 by then the cyclone had lasted 19 days reaching the equivalent of category 5 status on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale three times 9 the remnants of ioke accelerated northeastward and ultimately crossed into alaska 44 ioke did not affect any permanently populated areas in the central pacific or western pacific basins as a hurricane or a typhoon a crew of 12 people stayed in a hurricane-proof bunker on johnston atoll during the hurricane s passage the crew estimated winds reached over 100 mph 160 km h  which damaged trees on the island but did not impact the island s bird population 9 45 the hurricane left moderate damage on wake island totaling 88 million 2006 usd  which resulted from blown off roofs and damaged buildings although the infrastructure of the island was left intact all military personnel were evacuated from the island the first full-scale evacuation of the island since typhoon sarah in 1967. 46 47 48 later the extratropical remnants of ioke produced a severe storm surge along the alaskan coastline causing beach erosion 49 hurricane ileana edit category 3 hurricane sshws duration august 21 – august 27 peak intensity 120 mph 195 km h 1-min 955 mbar hpa main article hurricane ileana 2006 the origins of hurricane ileana were from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of africa on august 8. it entered the eastern north pacific on august 16 and developed into a tropical depression on august 21 near acapulco the depression strengthened into tropical storm ileana six hours after forming ileana continued to strengthen becoming a hurricane in 24 hours and a major hurricane a day after that ileana reached its peak intensity of 120 mph 195 km h before beginning a slow weakening phase on august 24 when it encountered cooler waters ileana weakened a tropical depression on the morning of august 27 and quickly degenerated into a remnant low dissipating on august 29. 50 as ileana was heading north along the mexican coastline slight rainfall was recorded along the coast 51 there were also reports of hurricane-force winds on socorro island 50 one fatality was reported when a man drowned in heavy surf near cabo san lucas 52 hurricane john edit category 4 hurricane sshws duration august 28 – september 4 peak intensity 130 mph 215 km h 1-min 948 mbar hpa main article hurricane john 2006 on august 28, a persistent area of low pressure southwest of acapulco mexico developed into a tropical depression later that day it strengthened into a tropical storm and it reached hurricane strength 24 hours later on august 29. john underwent rapid intensification and reached category 3 intensity later that day and category 4 on august 30. 53 hours later the hurricane underwent another eyewall replacement cycle 54 and subsequently weakened to category 3 status as it paralleled the mexican coastline a short distance offshore 55 potentially due to its eyewall replacement cycle or its interaction with land hurricane john weakened to a 105 mph hurricane by late on august 31, 56 but restrengthened to a major hurricane shortly after it made landfall near the southern tip of the baja california peninsula as a category 2 hurricane on september 1. 57 john continued northwestward along the eastern baja california peninsula weakening to tropical depression status by september 3 and dissipating on september 4 in the gulf of california 53 along the southwestern coast of mexico hurricane john produced heavy surf strong winds and heavy rainfall which flooded roads caused mudslides and downed trees 53 58 along the baja california peninsula the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall with a 24-hour peak of 10.8 inches 276 mm in los planes 59 the heavy rainfall caused flooding closed roads 60 and caused a dam to overflow 61 the winds and rainfall destroyed thousands of flimsy houses across the region 62 across mexico five people were killed 53 and damage amounted to 663 million 2006 mxn 60.8 million 2006 usd  63 moisture from the remnants of john produced flooding across texas which closed a ½ mile 800 m portion of interstate 10 in el paso 64 in southern new mexico the rainfall caused widespread street flooding and some minor damage 65 tropical moisture from the storm also produced rainfall in arizona and southern california where eight separate mudslides occurred trapping 19 vehicles but causing no injuries 66 hurricane kristy edit main article hurricane kristy 2006 category 1 hurricane sshws duration august 30 – september 8 peak intensity 80 mph 130 km h 1-min 985 mbar hpa on august 30, a tropical wave located about 525 miles 850 km south-southwest of baja california became more organized and was designated as the twelfth tropical depression of the 2006 season it strengthened into tropical storm kristy and became hurricane kristy the next day it did not retain this status for long partly due to its proximity to hurricane john 67 there was a possibility of a fujiwhara interaction between both systems causing kristy to weaken or perhaps be absorbed into the circulation of john 68 this did not occur however kristy weakened steadily after its peak intensity and looked to be close to dissipating but on september 3 and again on september 5, convection flared up and it returned to tropical storm strength 67 after oscillating between storm and depression strength the system degenerated into a remnant low on september 7, which dissipated on september 8 without affecting land 67 hurricane lane edit category 3 hurricane sshws duration

acapulco mexico gradually became better organized and was designated the thirteenth tropical depression of the 2006 season the depression intensified in a favorable environment and was upgraded to tropical storm lane later that night as it moved parallel to the mexican coast it continued to strengthen and became a hurricane on september 15, and a major hurricane early the next day hurricane lane reached peak winds of 125 mph 205 km h before it made landfall on the coast of sinaloa on september 16. it quickly weakened over land and dissipated on september 17. 69 tropical storm lane produced heavy rainfall and high seas along the west coast of mexico including acapulco where flood waters reached 16 inches 40 cm in depth the acapulco airport also experienced flooding though service was not interrupted 70 throughout mexico the hurricane caused four deaths and 2.2 billion 2006 mxn 203 million 2006 usd in damage 71 half of which in sinaloa where heavy crop damage was reported 72 an estimated 4,320 homes were affected by the hurricane and 19,200 miles 30,000 km of roads and highways were damaged to some degree including some destroyed bridges 71 tropical storm

convergence zone and a tropical wave developed a closed circulation on september 15. it moved northeastward due to the influence from nearby hurricane lane and organized enough to be declared tropical depression fourteen-e on september 16 while located about 500 miles southwest of cabo san lucas mexico it quickly strengthened and organized into tropical storm miriam later that day after reaching a peak intensity of 45 mph 70 km h  vertical wind shear and cooler waters rapidly weakened the storm and the circulation decoupled from the convection on september 17. after turning more towards the north miriam weakened to tropical depression status and on september 18 it degenerated to a remnant low the remnant circulation turned to the northwest then to the east and dissipated on september 21

analysis confirmed they were two separate systems initially the depression was in an area of favorable conditions with little wind shear and warm waters 9 as a result the cphc predicted significant strengthening to at least hurricane status 74 instead a high pressure system to its north increased wind shear over the depression causing the convection to become removed from the center the

development norman slowly began to weaken and on october 11 it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area turning eastward the system combined with a new tropical disturbance off the southwest mexican coast and slowly began to reorganize the system was re-designated a tropical depression on october 15 just south-southeast of manzanillo colima although within a few hours it again dissipated 75 the storm brought heavy rainfall to southwestern mexico peaking at 6.35 inches 161 mm in la villita michoacán 76 the rainfall caused flooding and mudslides around acapulco affecting 170 homes of

tropical depression sshws duration october 13 – october 14 peak intensity 35 mph 55 km h 1-min 1007 mbar hpa in the middle of october the intertropical convergence zone extended across the central pacific ocean resembling an extension of the monsoon trough an area of disturbed weather formed well to the southwest of hawaii organizing slowly for several days late on october 13, after the development of a low-level circulation and persistent convection the cphc classified the system as tropical depression four-c about 750 mi 1,200 km southwest of honolulu hawaii upon being classified the depression was located in an unusual steering flow that caused it to track eastward due to the approach of an upper-level trough it was expected to dissipate quickly from wind shear although forecasters noted the possibility for the trough to provide an outflow channel which might allow strengthening 83 on october 14, strong wind shear removed the convection completely from the center and the system degenerated into a remnant low 9 the remnant circulation continued slowly eastward dissipating on october 16. concurrently the convection tracked northeastward ahead of the upper-level trough which contributed to heavy rainfall and flooding on the island of hawaii on october 17. 9 the rainfall event coincided with an kiholo bay earthquake striking the area 84 hurricane paul edit

vertical shear and paul weakened to a tropical storm on october 24, later passing just south of the baja california peninsula paul weakened to a tropical depression on october 25 a short distance off the coast of mexico and after briefly turning away from the coast it made landfall on northwestern sinaloa on october 26. 85 paul was the third hurricane to threaten western mexico in the season the

depression sshws duration october 26 – october 27 peak intensity 35 mph 55 km h 1-min 1007 mbar hpa the origins of tropical depression eighteen-e were from a tropical wave that exited the coast of africa on october 7. it briefly spawned a low-pressure area as the wave continued westward without development on october 20, the wave entered the pacific ocean developing an area of thunderstorms about four days later by 1200 utc on october 26, a tropical depression formed about 155 mi 260 km south of manzanillo 90 initially tropical depression eighteen-e was located in an area of light wind shear and the nhc anticipated further organization and strengthening to near hurricane status 91 the tropical depression initially maintained a steady westward motion away from the mexican coastline due to a ridge north of the cyclone 91 by october 17, convection had decreased and the depression was not forecast to intensify as much 92 possibly due to intrusion of dry air the circulation became exposed from the thunderstorms and having weakened it turned to a southward drift 93 by 0000 utc on october 28, the system had weakened to a non-convective remnant low which dissipated the following day 90 tropical storm rosa edit tropical storm sshws duration november 8 – november 10 peak intensity 40 mph 65 km h 1-min 1002 mbar hpa a tropical wave exited western africa on october 22 and continued westward into the pacific on november 2, spawning a tropical depression on november 8 about 440 mi 710 km south of manzanillo colima 94 environmental conditions appeared favorable 95 although wind shear removed the convection from the circulation 96 throughout its duration the storm maintained a northwest track through a weakness in a subtropical ridge 97 by november 9, a new area of convection persisted near the center 98 and a banding feature formed 97 despite the shear the depression was upgraded to tropical storm rosa although the shear prevented intensification beyond its peak of 40 mph 65 km h  94 rosa remained a tropical storm for only 18 hours becoming a tropical depression early on november 10 and dissipating later that day 94 rosa was the first tropical storm in the basin to develop during november since 2000, and was also the first tropical depression to form in the month since 2002 s tropical depression sixteen-e no impact was reported from the storm 94 tropical depression twenty-e edit tropical depression sshws duration november 11 – november 11 peak intensity 35 mph 55 km h 1-min 1007 mbar hpa a tropical wave moved off the western coast of africa on october 21, briefly developing two weak low pressure areas before the wave crossed into the pacific ocean on november 1. thunderstorm activity slowly increased as the wave interacted within the intertropical convergence zone after a curved band of convection developed it is estimated the system formed into tropical depression twenty-e around 0000 utc on november 11, about 550 mi 1,050 km southwest of manzanillo throughout its duration the depression never completely separated from the intertropical convergence zone 99 when the nhc issued its first advisory on the depression the agency predicted slight intensification to tropical storm status and for the depression to last at least two days this was due to a forecast of gradually increasing wind shear after the first 24 hours 100 instead the circulation became very elongated it is estimated the cyclone degenerated into a trough by late on november 11. 99 hurricane sergio edit category 2 hurricane sshws duration november 13 – november 20 peak intensity 110 mph 175 km h 1-min 965 mbar hpa main article hurricane sergio 2006 just days after tropical depression twenty-e degenerated into an open trough tropical depression twenty one-e developed from a tropical wave on november 13 about 460 miles 740 km south of manzanillo colima it steadily intensified as it tracked southeastward reaching peak winds of 110 mph 175 km h on november 15. subsequently it began to weaken due to increased wind shear as it turned to the north sergio later turned to the west remaining well off the coast of mexico and it dissipated on november 20 about 320 miles 515 km west-northwest of where it originally formed 101 sergio produced light rainfall along the coast of mexico though its effects were minimal 102 the formation of sergio marked the 2006 season as the most active in 12 years and the second season in which more than one tropical storm formed in november after 1961. sergio set records for the month of november in the basin at the time it was considered the strongest hurricane to form in the month although it has since dropped to third after sandra from 2015, and kenneth from 2011. it is however still considered the longest-lived november pacific tropical cyclone with a duration of seven days 1 101 other systems edit the cyclone at peak intensity in the northeast pacific on november 1. main article 2006 central pacific cyclone on october 28, 2006, a cut-off extratropical cyclone stalled over the northeast pacific ocean and began to strengthen by october 31, the storm had acquired tropical characteristics including an eye convection and a warmer-than-average core the system reached peak intensity on november 1, before slowly weakening and looping towards the pacific northwest the system made landfall in washington state on november 3, before rapidly weakening and dissipating on the next day during the duration of the storm the system was known as storm 91c or invest 91c  the storm s true nature still remains controversial among meteorologists today due to disputes over the storm s exact structure and whether or not it had obtained tropical or subtropical characteristics because the storm was not within the area of responsibility of the national hurricane center or the central pacific hurricane center the storm was never assigned a name storm names edit the following names were used for named storms that formed in the northeast pacific in 2006. 103 this is the same list that was used in the 2000 season there were no names retired from the northeast pacific list therefore the same list was reused in the 2012 season aletta bud carlotta daniel emilia fabio gilma hector ileana john kristy lane miriam norman olivia paul rosa sergio tara unused vicente unused willa unused xavier unused yolanda unused zeke unused for storms that form in the central pacific hurricane center s area of responsibility encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the international date line all names are used in a series of four rotating lists the next four names that were slated for use in 2006 are shown below however only the name ioke was used ioke kika unused lana unused maka unused retirement edit the name ioke was retired from the north-central pacific list by the world meteorological organization in the spring of 2007 and replaced with iopa 104 during the 61st interdepartmental hurricane conference the hawaii state civil defense requested the retirement of the name daniel citing that the storm had become memorable due to threat of damage 105 however the request was denied as the name remains on the tropical cyclone naming list 103 season effects edit this is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 2006 pacific hurricane season it includes their duration names landfall s  denoted in parentheses damages and death totals deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect an example of an indirect death would be a traffic
