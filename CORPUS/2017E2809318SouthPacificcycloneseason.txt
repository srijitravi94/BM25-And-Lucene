120°w named by the rsmc nadi however should a tropical depression intensify to the south of 25°s between 160°e and 120°w it will be named in conjunction with rsmc nadi by tcwc wellington should a tropical cyclone move out of the basin and into the australian region it will retain its original name the next 10 names on the naming list are listed here below 5 fehi unused gita unused hola unused iris unused jo unused kala unused liua unused mona unused neil unused oma unused season effects edit this table lists all the storms that developed in the south pacific to the east of longitude 160°e during the 2017–18 season it includes their intensity on the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale duration name landfalls deaths and damages all data is taken from rsmc nadi and or tcwc wellington and all of the damage figures are in 2017 usd name dates active peak classification sustained wind speeds pressure areas affected damage usd deaths refs season aggregates 0 systems season not started not specified not specified
