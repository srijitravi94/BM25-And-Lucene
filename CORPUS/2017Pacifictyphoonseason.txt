agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names the japan meteorological agency jma will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km h 40 mph anywhere in the basin pagasa assigns unofficial names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 115°e–135°e and between 5°n–25°n regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the jma tropical depressions that are monitored by the
