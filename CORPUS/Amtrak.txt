billion passenger-miles 6 passenger trains were owned and operated by the same privately owned companies that operated freight trains 7 thereafter patronage declined in the face of competition from buses air travel and the automobile new streamlined diesel-powered trains such as the pioneer zephyr were popular with the traveling public but could not reverse the trend 8 by 1940 railroads held just 67 percent of commercial passenger-miles in the united states in real terms passenger-miles had fallen by 40 since 1916, from 42 billion to 25 billion 6 traffic surged during world war ii aided by troop movements and gasoline rationing railroad s market share surged to 74 in 1945, with a massive 94 billion passenger-miles 9 after the war railroads rejuvenated their overworked and neglected passenger fleets with fast and luxurious streamliners 10 these new trains brought only brief relief to the overall decline 11 even as postwar travel exploded passenger travel s percentage of the overall market share fell to 46 by 1950, and 32 by 1957. 6 the railroads had lost money on passenger service since the great depression but deficits reached 723 million in 1957. for many railroads these losses threatened their financial viability 12 the causes of this decline were many and debated the national highway system and airports both funded by the government competed directly with the railroads who paid for their own infrastructure 13 progressive era rate regulation limited the railroad s ability to turn a profit 14 railroads also faced antiquated work rules and inflexible relationships with trade unions to take one example workers continued to receive a day s pay for 100-to-150-mile 160 to 240 km work days streamliners covered that in two hours 15 matters approached a crisis in the 1960s passenger service route-miles fell from 107,000 miles 172,000 km in 1958 to 49,000 miles 79,000 km in 1970, the last full year of private operation 16 the diversion of most u.s postal service mail from passenger trains to trucks airplanes and freight trains in late 1967 deprived those trains of badly-needed revenue 17 in direct response the atchison topeka and santa fe railway filed to discontinue 33 of its remaining 39 trains ending almost all passenger service on one of the largest railroads in the country 18 the equipment the railroads had ordered after world war

shown as passenger service declined various proposals were brought forward to rescue it the 1961 doyle report proposed that the private railroads pool their services into a single body 20 similar proposals were made in 1965 and 1968, but failed to attract support the federal government passed the high speed ground transportation act of 1965 to fund pilot programs in the northeast corridor but this did nothing to address passenger deficits in late 1969 multiple proposals emerged in congress including equipment subsidies route subsidies and lastly a quasi-public corporation to take over the operation of intercity passenger trains matters were brought to a head on march 5, 1970, when the penn central the largest railroad in the northeast united states and teetering on bankruptcy filed to discontinue 34 of its passenger trains 21 in october 1970, congress passed and president richard nixon signed into law the rail passenger service act proponents of the bill led by the national association of railroad passengers narp  sought government funding to ensure the continuation of passenger trains they conceived the national railroad passenger corporation nrpc  a private entity that would receive taxpayer funding and assume operation of intercity passenger trains 22 the original working brand name for nrpc was railpax but shortly before the company started operating it was changed to amtrak 23 there were several key provisions 24 any railroad operating intercity passenger service could contract with the nrpc thereby joining the national system participating railroads bought into the nrpc using a formula based on their recent intercity passenger losses the purchase price could be satisfied either by cash or rolling stock in exchange the railroads received nrpc common stock any participating railroad was freed of the obligation to operate intercity passenger service after may 1, 1971, except for those services chosen by the department of transportation dot as part of a basic system of service and paid for by nrpc using its federal funds railroads that chose not to join the nrpc system were required to continue operating their existing passenger service until 1975 and thenceforth had to pursue the customary icc approval process for any discontinuance or alteration to the service of the 26 railroads still offering intercity passenger service in 1970, only six declined to join amtrak 25 nearly everyone involved expected the experiment to be short-lived the nixon administration and many washington insiders viewed the nrpc as a politically expedient way for the president and congress to give passenger trains a last hurrah as demanded by the public they expected amtrak to quietly disappear as public interest waned 26 after fortune magazine exposed the manufactured mismanagement in 1974, louis w menk chairman of the burlington northern railroad remarked that the story was undermining the scheme to dismantle amtrak 27 proponents also hoped that government intervention would be brief but their view was that amtrak would soon support itself neither view has proved correct popular support has allowed amtrak to continue in operation longer than critics imagined while financial results have made a return to private operation infeasible citation needed 1970s the rainbow era edit a burlington northern emd f3 leads the north coast hiawatha into

in 1975. by the mid-1970s amtrak equipment was acquiring its own identity amtrak began operations on may 1, 1971. 28 amtrak received no rail tracks or rights-of-way at its inception all amtrak s routes were continuations of prior service although amtrak pruned about half the passenger rail network of the 364 trains operated previously amtrak only continued 182. on trains that continued to the extent possible schedules were retained with only minor changes from the official guide of the railways and under the same names citation needed several major corridors became freight-only including

maintenance and redundant facilities resulting from competing companies that served the same areas on the day it started amtrak was given the responsibility of rerouting passenger trains from the seven train terminals in chicago lasalle dearborn grand central randolph chicago northwestern terminal central and union into just one union station in new york city amtrak had to pay to maintain both penn station and grand central terminal because of the lack of track connections to bring trains from upstate new york into penn station a problem not rectified until the building of the empire connection in 1991. citation needed amtrak would abandon numerous large stations whose upkeep could no longer be justified on the other hand the creation of the los angeles–seattle coast starlight

often called the rainbow era which refers to the ad hoc arrangement of the rolling stock and locomotives from a pool of equipment acquired by amtrak at its formation that consisted of a large mix of paint schemes from their former owners this rolling stock which for the most part still bore the pre-amtrak colors and logos formed the multi-colored consists of early amtrak trains by mid-1971 amtrak began purchasing some of the equipment it had leased including 286 second-hand locomotives of the emd e and f types  30 gg1 electric locomotives and 1,290 passenger cars and continued leasing even more motive power by 1975, the official amtrak color scheme was painted on most amtrak equipment and newly purchased locomotives and rolling stock began appearing 29 amtrak soon had the opportunity to acquire rights-of-way following the bankruptcy of several northeastern railroads in the early 1970s including penn central which owned and operated the northeast corridor nec  congress passed the railroad revitalization and regulatory reform act of 1976. 30 a large part of the legislation was directed to the creation of conrail but the law also enabled the transfer of the portions of the nec not already owned by state authorities to amtrak amtrak acquired the majority of the nec on april 1, 1976. 31 the portion in massachusetts is owned by the commonwealth and managed by amtrak the route from new haven to new rochelle is owned by the metropolitan transportation authority and the connecticut department of transportation as the new haven line citation needed this main line became amtrak s jewel asset and helped the railroad generate revenue while the nec ridership and revenues were higher than any other segment of the system the cost of operating and maintaining the corridor proved to be overwhelming as a result amtrak s federal subsidy was increased dramatically in subsequent years other short route segments not needed for freight operations were transferred to amtrak citation needed in its first decade amtrak fell far short of financial independence which continues today but it did find modest success rebuilding trade outside factors discouraged competing transport such as fuel shortages which increased costs of automobile and airline travel and strikes which disrupted airline operations investments in amtrak s track equipment and information also made amtrak more

disastrous financial results during the carter administration 1977–81  35 page needed despite frequent clashes with the reagan administration over funding claytor enjoyed a good relationship with john h riley the head of the federal railroad administration fra  and with members of congress limited funding led claytor to use short-term debt to fund operations 36 building on mechanical developments in the 1970s high speed washington-new york metroliner service was improved with new equipment and faster schedules travel time between new york and washington d.c was reduced to under 3 hours 37 according to the 1980 amtrak annual report a converted 12-car set saved the company approximately 250,000 a year in fuel maintenance and yard support costs amtrak completed the head-end power conversion program in 1982. demand for passenger rail service resulted in the creation of five new state-supported routes in california illinois missouri oregon and pennsylvania for a total of 15 state-supported routes across the nation ridership stagnated at roughly 20 million passengers per year amid uncertain government aid from 1981 to about 2000. 34 38 thomas downs succeeded claytor in 1993. amtrak s stated goal remained operational self-sufficiency by this time however amtrak had a large overhang of debt from years of underfunding and in the mid-1990s amtrak suffered through a serious cash crunch under downs congress included a provision in the taxpayer relief act of 1997 that resulted in amtrak receiving a 2.3 billion tax refund that resolved their cash crisis 39 however congress also instituted a glide-path to financial self-sufficiency excluding railroad retirement tax act payments 40 george warrington became president in 1998 with a mandate to make amtrak financially self-sufficient passengers became guests and there were expansions into express freight work but the financial plans failed amtrak s inroads in express freight delivery created additional

of the 21st century after implementation of capital improvements in the nec and rises in automobile fuel costs the inauguration of the high-speed acela express in late 2000 generated considerable publicity and led to major ridership gains however through the late 1990s and very early 21st century amtrak could not add sufficient express freight revenue or cut sufficient other expenditures to break even by 2002, it was clear that amtrak could not achieve self-sufficiency but congress continued to authorize funding and released amtrak from the requirement 41 in early 2002 david l gunn replaced warrington as president in a departure from his predecessors promises to make amtrak self-sufficient in the short term gunn argued that no form of passenger transportation in the united states is self-sufficient as the economy is currently structured 42 highways airports and air traffic control all require large government expenditures to build and operate coming from the highway trust fund and aviation trust fund paid for by user fees highway fuel and road taxes and in the case of the general fund from general taxation 43 gunn dropped most freight express business and worked to eliminate deferred maintenance 44 a plan by the bush administration to privatize parts of the national passenger rail system and spin off other parts to partial state ownership provoked disagreement within amtrak s board of directors late in 2005 gunn was fired 45 gunn s replacement alexander kummant 2006–08  was committed to operating a national rail network and like gunn opposed the notion of putting the northeast corridor under separate ownership 46 he said that shedding the system s long-distance routes would amount to selling national assets that are on par with national parks and that amtrak s abandonment of these routes would be irreversible in late 2006, amtrak unsuccessfully sought annual congressional funding of 1 billion for ten years 46 in early 2007, amtrak employed 20,000 people in 46 states and served 25 million passengers a year its highest amount since its founding in 1970. politico noted a key problem the rail system chronically operates in the red a pattern has emerged congress overrides cutbacks demanded by the white house and appropriates enough funds to keep amtrak from plunging into insolvency but amtrak advocates say that is not enough to fix the system s woes 47 joseph h boardman replaced kummant as president and ceo in late 2008. 48 in 2011, amtrak announced its intention to build a small segment of a high-speed rail corridor from penn station in nyc under the hudson river in new tunnels and double-tracking the line to newark nj called the gateway project estimated to cost 13.5 billion 49 50 51 after years of almost revolving-door ceos at amtrak in december 2013, boardman was named railroader of the year by railway age magazine which noted that with over five years in the job he is the second-longest serving head

employees that he would be leaving amtrak in september 2016. he had advised the amtrak board of directors of his decision the previous week on august 19, 2016, the amtrak board of directors named former norfolk southern railway president ceo charles wick moorman as boardman s successor with an effective date of september 1, 2016. 58 during his term moorman took no salary 59 and said that he saw his role as one of a “transitional ceo” who would reorganize amtrak before turning it over to new leadership 60 in may and june 2017, following several service disruptions within pennsylvania station and the east river tunnels the train service announced an expedited schedule for maintenance and repairs of infrastructure which involves the complete shutdown of multiple tracks at a time 61 amtrak has faced criticism from commuters as well as politicians for these incidents prompting responses from figures such as new jersey governor chris christie and new york governor andrew cuomo the repairs are expected to take place in summer 2017, affecting the long island rail road and new jersey transit trains during all hours who have planned additional or modified services 62 63 in june 2017, it was announced that former delta and northwest airlines ceo richard anderson would become amtrak s next president ceo 60 anderson began the job on july 12, assuming the title of president

wyoming and south dakota  amtrak services fall into three groups short-haul service on the northeast corridor state-supported short haul service outside the northeast corridor and long-distance service known within amtrak as the national network amtrak receives federal funding for the vast majority of its operations including the central spine of the northeast corridor between boston and washington dc as well as for its national long distance routes in addition to the federally funded routes amtrak partners with transportation agencies in 18 states to operate other short and medium haul routes outside of the northeast corridor some of which connect to it or are extensions off of it in addition to its inter-city services amtrak also operates commuter services for three state agencies including marc in maryland shore line east in connecticut and metrolink in california service on the northeast corridor between boston and washington d.c. as well as between philadelphia and harrisburg is powered by overhead electric wires for the rest of the system diesel locomotives are used routes vary widely in frequency of service from three-days-a-week trains on the sunset limited to weekday service several times per hour on the northeast corridor nec  65 amtrak also operates a captive bus service thruway motorcoach which provides connections to train routes 66 the most popular and heavily used services are those running on the nec including the acela express and northeast regional the nec runs from boston to washington d.c via new york city and philadelphia some services continue into virginia the nec services accounted for 11.4 million of amtrak s 31.6 million passengers in fiscal year 2013. 67 outside the nec the most popular services are the short-haul corridors in california these include the pacific surfliner capitol corridor and san joaquin supplemented by an extensive network of connecting buses together the california corridor trains accounted for a combined 5,627,000 passengers in fiscal year 2013. 67 other popular corridors include the empire service which operates between new york city and toronto ontario via albany and buffalo new york and carried about 1,538,000 passengers in 2015, and the keystone service from new york city to harrisburg pennsylvania via philadelphia that carried 1,343,000 passengers in 2015. 68 four of the six

california citation needed on-time performance edit outside the northeast corridor and stretches of track in southern california and michigan most amtrak trains run on tracks owned and operated by privately owned freight railroads freight rail operators are required under federal law to give dispatching preference to amtrak trains some freight railroads have been accused of violating or skirting these regulations allegedly resulting in passenger trains waiting in sidings for an hour or longer while waiting for freight traffic to clear the track the railroads dispatching practices were investigated in 2008, 81 resulting in stricter laws about train priority subsequently amtrak s overall on-time performance went up from 74.7 in fiscal 2008 to 84.7 in 2009, with long-distance trains and others outside the nec seeing the greatest benefit the missouri river runner jumped from 11 to 95  becoming one of amtrak s best performers the texas eagle went from 22.4 to 96.7  and the california zephyr with a 5 on-time record in 2008, went up to 78.3  82 this improved performance coincided with a general economic downturn resulting in the lowest freight-rail traffic volumes since at least 1988, meaning less freight traffic to impede passenger traffic 83 ridership edit annual ridership by fiscal year 1971–2012 amtrak carried 15,848,327 passengers in 1972, its first full year of

originally imposed by congress most amtrak workers were traditionally classified as railroad employees and contributions to the railroad retirement system have been made for those employees however because the size of the contributions is determined on an industry-wide basis rather than with reference to the employer for whom the employees work some critics such as the national association of railroad passengers maintain that amtrak is subsidizing freight railroad pensions by as much as us 150 million year 130 in recent times efforts at reforming passenger rail have addressed labor issues in 1997 congress released amtrak from a prohibition on contracting for labor outside the corporation and outside its unions  opening the door to privatization 131 since that time many of amtrak s employees have been working without a contract the most recent contract signed in 1999, was mainly retroactive because of the fragmentation of railroad unions by job as of 2009 update amtrak has 14 separate unions to negotiate with plus it has 24 separate contracts with those unions 132 this makes it difficult to make substantial changes in contrast to a situation where one union negotiates with one employer former amtrak president kummant followed a cooperative posture with amtrak s trade unions ruling out plans to privatize large parts of amtrak s unionized workforce 133 public funding edit

million in federally insured loans and a somewhat larger private contribution 136 officials expected that amtrak would break even by 1974, but those expectations proved unrealistic and annual direct federal aid reached a 17-year high in 1981 of 1.25 billion 137 during the reagan administration appropriations were halved and by 1986, federal support fell to a decade low of 601 million almost none of which were capital appropriations 138 in the late 1980s and early 1990s congress continued the reductionist trend even while amtrak expenses held steady or rose amtrak was forced to borrow to meet short-term operating needs and by 1995 amtrak was on the brink of a cash crisis and was unable to continue to service its debts 139 in response in 1997 congress authorized 5.2 billion for amtrak over the next five years – largely to complete the acela capital project – on the condition that amtrak submit to the ultimatum of self-sufficiency by 2003 or liquidation 140 while amtrak made financial improvements during this period citation needed it did not achieve self-sufficiency 141 2000s edit amtrak s piedmont near charlotte north carolina with a state-owned locomotive this route is run under a partnership with the north carolina department of transportation 2003 amtrak cascades service with tilting talgo trainsets in seattle washington 2006 in 2004, a stalemate in federal support of amtrak forced cutbacks in services and routes as well as resumption of deferred maintenance in fiscal 2004 and 2005, congress appropriated about 1.2 billion for amtrak 300 million more than president george w bush had requested however the company s board requested 1.8 billion through fiscal 2006, the majority of which about 1.3 billion would be used to bring infrastructure rolling stock and motive power back to a state of good repair in congressional testimony the dot inspector general confirmed that amtrak would need at least 1.4 billion to 1.5 billion in fiscal 2006 and 2 billion in fiscal 2007 just to maintain the status quo in 2006, amtrak received just under 1.4 billion with the condition that amtrak would reduce but not eliminate food and sleeper service losses thus dining service was simplified and now requires two fewer on-board service workers only auto train and empire builder services continue regular made-on-board meal service in 2010 the senate approved a bill to provide 1.96 billion to amtrak but cut the approval for high-speed rail to a 1 billion appropriation 141 state governments have partially filled the breach left by reductions in federal aid several states have entered into operating partnerships with amtrak notably california pennsylvania illinois michigan oregon missouri washington north carolina oklahoma texas wisconsin vermont maine and new york as well as the canadian province of british columbia which provides some of the resources for the operation of the cascades route with the dramatic rise in gasoline prices during 2007–08 amtrak has seen record ridership 142 capping a steady five-year increase in ridership overall regional lines saw 12 year-over-year growth in may 2008. 143 in october 2007, the senate passed s-294 passenger rail improvement and investment act of 2007 70–22 sponsored by senators frank lautenberg and trent lott despite a veto threat by president bush a similar bill passed the house on june 11, 2008, with a veto-proof margin 311–104  144 the final bill spurred on by the september 12 metrolink collision in california and retitled rail safety improvement act of 2008, was signed into law by president bush on october 16, 2008. the bill appropriates 2.6 billion a year in amtrak funding through 2013. 145 2010s edit amtrak points out that in 2010, its farebox recovery percentage of operating costs covered by revenues generated by passenger fares was 79  the highest reported for any u.s passenger railroad 67 amtrak has argued that it needs to increase capital program costs in 2013 in order to replace old train equipment because the multi-year maintenance costs for those trains exceeds what it would cost to simply buy new equipment that would not need to be repaired for several years however despite an initial request for more than 2.1 billion in funding for the year the company had to deal with a year-over-year cut in 2013 federal appropriations dropping to under 1.4 billion for the first time in several years 134 amtrak stated in 2010 that the backlog of needed repairs of the track it owns on the northeast corridor included over 200 bridges most dating to the 19th century tunnels under baltimore dating to the american civil war era and functionally obsolete track switches which would cost 5.2 billion to repair more than triple amtrak s total annual budget  146 amtrak s budget is only allocated on a yearly basis and it has been argued by joseph vranich that this makes multi-year development programs and long-term fiscal planning difficult if not impossible 147 page needed in fiscal year 2011, the u.s congress granted amtrak 563 million for operating and 922 million for capital programs 148 controversy edit government aid to amtrak was controversial from the beginning the formation of amtrak in 1971 was criticized as a bailout serving corporate rail interests and union railroaders not the traveling public critics have asserted that amtrak has proven incapable of operating as a business and that it does not provide valuable transportation services meriting public support 147 page needed a mobile money-burning machine 149 many argued that subsidies should be ended national rail service terminated and the nec turned over to private interests to fund a nostalgia limited is not in the public interest 150 critics also question amtrak s energy efficiency 151 though the u.s department of energy considers amtrak among the most energy-efficient forms of transportation 152 the rail passenger service act of 1970, which established amtrak specifically states that the corporation will not be an agency or establishment of the united states government  153 then common stock was issued in 1971 to railroads that contributed capital and equipment these shares convey almost no benefits 154 but their current holders 155 declined a 2002 buy-out offer by amtrak there are currently 109,396,994 shares of preferred stock at a par value of
