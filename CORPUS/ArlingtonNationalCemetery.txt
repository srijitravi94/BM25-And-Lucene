examination of eligible sites be made for the establishment for a large new national military cemetery within weeks his staff reported that arlington estate was the most suitable property in the area 12 the property was high and free from floods which might unearth graves  it had a view of the district of columbia and it was aesthetically pleasing it was also the home of the leader of the armed forces of the confederate states of america and denying robert e lee use of his home after the war was a valuable political consideration 13 the first military burial at arlington for william henry christman was made on may 13, 1864, 14 close to what is now the northeast gate in section 27. 15 however meigs did not formally authorize establishment of burials until june 15, 1864. 16 arlington did

constructed rental houses that 1,100 to 3,000 freed slaves eventually occupied while farming 1,100 acres 450 ha of the estate and receiving schooling and occupational training during the civil war and after war ended 21 24 however after the land became part of a military reservation the government asked the villagers to leave when some remained john a commerford the superintendent of arlington national cemetery asked the army s quartermaster general in 1887 to close the village on the grounds that people living in the village had been taking trees at night from the cemetery for use as

buried at arlington the need for additional burial space at the cemetery became a pressing issue in 1991, cemetery superintendent john c metzler jr. implemented a 1.4 million plan to clear a former 13 acres 5.3 ha parking lot to create space for about 9,000 new grave sites 26 the cemetery received the authority to transfer 12 acres 4.9 ha of woodland from the nps-controlled arlington house in 1996

additional 26,000 graves and 5,000 inurnments the millennium project expanded the cemetery s physical boundaries for the first time since the 1960s and was the largest expansion of burial space at the site since the american civil war 35 several environmental and historical preservation groups criticized metzler s plans as did the nps and the manager of arlington house 35 36 37 on march 26, 2013, the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act 2013 public law 113-6 appropriated to the dod 84 million to plan design and construct the millennium project 38 the legislation additionally appropriated to the dod 19 million to study plan and design a future expansion of the cemetery s burial space 38 navy annex property expansion controversy edit in 1998, a congressional proposal to expand the cemetery onto land that the navy annex and fort myer then occupied led to concerns that arlington county officials had not been properly consulted leading to the withdrawal of the proposal 39 however the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2000 public law 106-65  which was enacted into law during october 1999, subsequently required the secretary of defense to transfer to the secretary of the army administrative jurisdiction of the 36 acres 15 ha navy annex property the act required the secretary of defense to demolish the annex s buildings and prepare the property for use as part of the cemetery while requiring the secretary of the army to incorporate the annex property into the cemetery 32 in january 2013, the county manager of arlington county virginia and the executive director of the army national military cemeteries consisting of arlington national cemetery and the united states soldiers and airmen s home national cemetery 40 signed a memorandum of

southgate road which lies between the navy annex property and the cemetery s 2012 boundary  and obtain a narrow easement along the southwest border of the navy annex site for a new southgate road in exchange the department of defense would give the navy annex parking lot to the county the army would also transfer land west of south joyce street to columbia pike to arlington county additionally the commonwealth of virginia would convey to the cemetery roughly the northern half of the virginia department of transportation land bounded by south joyce street columbia pike and south washington boulevard the cloverleaf interchange between columbia pike and s washington blvd would be eliminated and the hairpin turn in columbia pike straightened to provide a safer more natural exit from s washington blvd onto columbia pike although exact acreages were not specified and the plan depended upon the commonwealth of virginia s cooperation the mou if implemented would have created a more contiguous plot of land for the cemetery 41 however in december 2016, the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 public law 114-328 authorized the secretary of the army to expand the cemetery by acquiring from arlington county and the commonwealth of virginia by condemnation and other means properties near the cemetery that contain the southgate road south joyce street and washington boulevard right-of-ways including the washington boulvard-columbia pike interchange 42 the army then informed the arlington county government in june 2017 that the army would no longer pursue a land exchange with the county the army told the county that the army would use the entire navy annex site to expand the cemetery and would acquire for the cemetery about 5 acres 2.0 ha of public land that arlington county then owned the army would also acquire for the cemetery expansion about 7 acres 2.8 ha of land located between columbia pike and interstate 395 that the commonwealth of virginia then owned 43 arlington woods expansion controversy edit a portion of arlington woods on humphreys drive 2013 on february 22, 1995, officials of the united states department of the interior and the united states department of the army signed an agreement to transfer from arlington house the robert e lee memorial to the army a part of arlington woods which was located in section 29 of the nps at arlington national cemetery between arlington house and fort myer 44 the property transfer which involved 12 acres 4.9 ha of nps land was intended to permit metzler to start expanding the cemetery beyond its existing boundaries 28 45 environmentalists expressed concerns that the agreement would result in the partial destruction of the 24 acres 9.7 ha remnant of an historically important stand of native trees 37 46 a historical marker near the woodland notes that while visiting arlington house in 1825, gilbert du motier marquis de lafayette had warned mary lee fitzhugh custis the wife of george washington parke custis cherish these forest trees around your mansion recollect how much easier it is to cut a tree than to make one grow the marker further notes that the

authorization act for fiscal year 1997 public law 104-201 authorized the secretary of the interior to transfer to the secretary of the army all of the land in section 29 that was within an arlington national cemetery interment zone and some of the land in the section that was within a robert e lee memorial preservation zone  27 28 on march 5, 1998, the nps which is a component of the department of the interior informed the national capital planning commission that it wanted to transfer only 4 acres 1.6 ha to the cemetery rather than the 12 acres 4.9 ha that the 1995 agreement had described in response metzler stated i was surprised but we will continue to work with the department of interior and see what happens 28 on july 12, 1999, the nps issued a federal register notice that announced the availability of an environmental assessment ea for the transfer 45 48 the ea stated that the interment zone contained the oldest and largest tract of climax eastern hardwood forest in arlington county this forest was the same type that once covered the arlington estate and had regenerated from trees that were present historically a forestry study determined that a representative tree was 258 years old the interment zone was also determined to contain significant archeological and cultural landscape resources in addition to those in the preservation zone 48 the ea described four alternative courses of action 48 in contrast to the nps s march 1998 statement to the national capital planning commission the 1999 ea stated that the preferred alternative alternative 1 would transfer to the cemetery approximately 9.6 acres 3.9 ha  comprising most of the interment zone and the northern tip of the preservation zone 48 another alternative alternative 3 would transfer to the cemetery the 12 acres 4.9 ha interment zone while keeping the 12.5 acres 5.1 ha preservation zone under nps jurisdiction 48 the ea concluded public law 104-201 directed the secretary of the interior to transfer to the secretary of the army jurisdiction over the interment zone which is the plan in alternative 3. adoption of any of the other alternatives would require legislative action to amend the existing law 48 map showing the millennium project s expansion of arlington national cemetery into arlington woods and fort myer on december 28, 2001, the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2002 public law 107-107 repealed the obsolete part of public law 104-201 that had authorized the transfer of portions of section 29 to the secretary of the army 30 the new legislation required the secretary of the interior to transfer to the secretary of the army within 30 days the approximately 12 acres 4.9 ha interment zone 30 the transfer therefore involved the entire 12 acres 4.9 ha of nps land that the 1995 agreement and alternative 3 in the 1999 ea had described the 2001 legislation required the secretary of the army to use the interment zone for in-ground burial sites and columbarium 30 in addition the legislation required the secretary of the interior to manage the remainder of section 29 in perpetuity to provide a natural setting and visual buffer for arlington

woodland the draft ea described seven alternatives the preferred alternative alternative e called for the removal of about one-half of the 1,700 trees with a diameter of 6 inches 15 cm or greater on the site about 640 of the trees were within a 135-year-old portion of arlington woods 52 the draft ea concluded based on the evaluation of environmental impacts..... no significant impacts would be expected from the proposed action therefore an environmental impact statement will not be prepared and a finding of no significant impact will be prepared and signed 52 on march 12, 2013, the corps of engineers released a revised ea for the millennium project 53 54 the revised ea contained copies of a number of public comments on the draft ea that had criticized the project and parts of the ea while proposing alternative locations for new military burials near the cemetery and elsewhere 55 however the department of forestry of the commonwealth of virginia found that based on information in the draft ea the project would not have a significant adverse impact on the commonwealth s forest resources 56 the revised ea did not change the preferred alternative alternative e or the army s plans to prepare and sign the finding of no significant impact fonsi that the draft ea had described 57 on june 5, 2013, after reviewing 100 public comments that it had received on the revised ea the corps of engineers released a final ea and a signed fonsi for the millennium project 58 59 the final ea and the fonsi retained alternative e as the preferred alternative 58 the final ea stated that of the 905 trees to be removed 771 trees were healthy native trees that had diameters between 6 and 41 inches 60 61 the project would remove approximately 211 trees from a less than 2.63 acres 1.06 ha area containing a portion of a 145-year-old forest that stood within the property boundaries of a historic district that a national register of historic places nomination form for arlington house had

on top of one another 64 metzler who had already announced his intention to retire on july 2, 2010, admitted some mistakes had been made but denied allegations of widespread or serious mismanagement 64 the investigation also found that cemetery employees were burdened in their day-to-day work by dysfunctional management lack of established policy and procedures and an overall unhealthy organizational climate 65 66 both metzler and higgenbotham retired soon after the investigation commenced 67 in march 2011, as a result of the problems discovered kathryn condon the recently appointed executive director of the army national military cemeteries announced that the cemetery s staff had been increased from 102 to 159. she added that the cemetery was also acquiring additional equipment because they didn t have the proper equipment to do the job really to the standard they needed to do 68 the mismanagement controversy included a limitation on mass media access to funerals which also proved controversial until 2005, the cemetery s administration gave free access with the family s permission to the press to cover funerals at the cemetery according to the washington post in 2008, the cemetery gradually imposed increasing restrictions on media coverage of funerals beginning about 2005. 69 management turnover edit after the cemetery s management controversy began to end the army
