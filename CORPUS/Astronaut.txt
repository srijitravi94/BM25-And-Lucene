by a human spaceflight program to command pilot or serve as a crew member of a spacecraft although generally reserved for professional space travelers the terms are sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space including scientists politicians journalists and tourists 1 2 starting in the 1950s up to 2002, astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments either by the military or by civilian space agencies with the suborbital flight of the privately funded spaceshipone in 2004, a new category of astronaut was created the commercial astronaut definition alan shepard aboard freedom 7 the criteria for what constitutes human spaceflight vary the fédération aéronautique internationale fai sporting code for astronautics recognizes only flights that exceed an altitude of 100 kilometers 62 mi  3 in the united states professional military and commercial astronauts who travel above an altitude of 50 miles 80 km 4 are awarded astronaut wings as of 17 november 2016 update  a total of 552 people from 36 countries have reached 100 km 62 mi or more in altitude of which 549 reached low earth orbit or beyond 5 of these 24 people have traveled beyond low earth orbit to either lunar orbit the lunar surface or in one case a loop around the moon 6 three of the 24 did so twice jim lovell john young and eugene cernan 7 the three astronauts who have not reached low earth orbit are spaceplane pilots joe walker mike melvill and brian binnie as of 17 november 2016 update  under the u.s definition 558 people qualify as having reached space above 50 miles 80 km altitude of eight x-15 pilots who exceeded 50 miles 80 km in altitude only one exceeded 100 kilometers about 62 miles  5 space travelers have spent over 41,790 man-days 114.5 man-years in space including over 100 astronaut-days of spacewalks 8 9 as of 2016, the man with the longest cumulative time in space is gennady padalka who has spent 879 days in space 10 peggy a whitson holds the record for the most time in space by a woman 377 days 11 terminology see also astronaut ranks and positions in 1959, when both the united states and soviet union were planning but had yet to launch humans into space nasa administrator t keith glennan and his deputy administrator dr hugh dryden discussed whether spacecraft crew members should be called astronauts or cosmonauts dryden preferred cosmonaut  on the grounds that flights would occur in the cosmos near space  while the astro prefix suggested flight to the stars most nasa space task group members preferred astronaut  which survived by common usage as the preferred american term 12 when the soviet union launched the first man into space yuri gagarin in 1961, they chose a term which anglicizes to cosmonaut  english in english-speaking nations a professional space traveler is called an astronaut 13 the term derives from the greek words ástron ἄστρον  meaning star  and nautes ναύτης  meaning sailor  the first known use of the term astronaut in the modern sense was by neil r jones in his short story the death s head meteor in 1930. the word itself had been known earlier for example in percy greg s 1880 book across the zodiac astronaut referred to a spacecraft in les navigateurs de l infini 1925 of j.-h rosny aîné the word astronautique astronautic was used the word may have been inspired by aeronaut  an older term for an air traveler first applied in 1784 to balloonists an early use in a non-fiction publication is eric frank russell s poem the astronaut in the november 1934 bulletin of the british interplanetary society 14 the first known formal use of the term astronautics in the scientific community was the establishment of the annual international astronautical congress in 1950 and the subsequent founding of the international astronautical federation the following year 15 nasa applies the term astronaut to any crew member aboard nasa spacecraft bound for earth orbit or beyond nasa also uses the term as a title for those selected to join its astronaut corps 16 the european space agency similarly uses the term astronaut for members of its astronaut corps 17 russian main article soviet space program see also list of cosmonauts by convention an astronaut employed by the russian federal space agency or its soviet predecessor is called a cosmonaut in english texts 16 the word is an anglicisation of the russian word kosmonavt russian космонавт russian pronunciation kəsmɐˈnaft  one who works in space outside the earth s atmosphere a space traveler 18 which derives from the greek words kosmos κόσμος  meaning universe  and nautes ναύτης  meaning sailor  other countries of the former eastern bloc use variations of the russian word kosmonavt such as the polish kosmonauta coinage of the term kosmonavt has been credited to soviet aeronautics pioneer mikhail tikhonravov 1900–1974  19 20 the first cosmonaut was soviet air force pilot yuri gagarin also the first person in space valentina tereshkova a russian factory worker was the first woman in space as well as the first civilian among the soviet cosmonaut or nasa astronaut corps to make a spaceflight on march 14, 1995, norman thagard became the first american to ride to space on board a russian launch vehicle and thus became the first american cosmonaut  chinese main article chinese space program see also list of chinese

hong kong and taiwan 23 the term taikonaut is used by some english-language news media organizations for professional space travelers from china 24 the word has featured in the longman and oxford english dictionaries the latter of which describes it as a hybrid of the chinese term taikong space and the greek naut sailor the term became more common in 2003 when china sent its first astronaut yang liwei into space aboard the shenzhou 5 spacecraft 25 this is the term used by xinhua news agency in the english version of the chinese people s daily since the advent of the chinese space program 26 the origin of the term is unclear as early as may 1998, chiew lee yih 趙裡昱 from malaysia used it in newsgroups 27 28 other terms with the rise of space tourism nasa and the russian federal space agency agreed to use the term spaceflight participant to distinguish those space travelers from professional astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies while no nation other than the russian federation and previously the former soviet union  the united states and china have launched a manned spacecraft several other nations have sent people into space in cooperation with one of these countries inspired partly by these missions other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional english usage for example the term spationaut french spelling spationaute is sometimes used to describe french space travelers from the latin word spatium for space  the malay term angkasawan was used to describe participants in the angkasawan program and the indian space research organisation

training in 1959. 55 early in the space program military jet test piloting and engineering training were often cited as prerequisites for selection as an astronaut at nasa although neither john glenn nor scott carpenter of the mercury seven had any university degree in engineering or any other discipline at the time of their selection selection was initially limited to military pilots 56 57 the earliest astronauts for both america and the ussr tended to be jet fighter pilots and were often test pilots once selected nasa astronauts go through twenty months of training in a variety of areas including training for extravehicular activity in a facility such as nasa s neutral buoyancy laboratory 1 56 astronauts-in-training may also experience short periods of weightlessness in aircraft called the vomit comet  the nickname given to a pair of modified kc-135s retired in 2000 and 2004 respectively and replaced in 2005 with a c-9 which perform parabolic flights 55 astronauts are also required to accumulate a number of flight hours in high-performance jet aircraft this is mostly done in t-38 jet aircraft out of ellington field due to its proximity to the johnson space center

being conducted in space via the national space and biomedical research institute nsbri to address these issues prominent among these is the advanced diagnostic ultrasound in microgravity study in which astronauts including former iss commanders leroy chiao and gennady padalka perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space this study s techniques are now being applied to cover professional and olympic sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by non-expert operators in medical and high school students it is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is often rare 76 77 78 a 2006 space

american uses about 35 gallons 132 liters of water every day on board the iss astronauts limit water use to only about three gallons 11 liters per day 90 insignia in russia cosmonauts are awarded pilot-cosmonaut of the russian federation upon completion of their missions often accompanied with the award of hero of the russian federation this follows the practice established in the ussr where cosmonauts were usually awarded the title hero of the soviet union at nasa those who complete astronaut candidate training receive a silver lapel pin once they have flown in space they receive a gold
