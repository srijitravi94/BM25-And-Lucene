australia s national broadcaster funded by australian taxpayers but specifically independent of government and politics in the commonwealth the abc plays a leading role in journalistic independence and is fundamental in the history of broadcasting in australia its model based on – but not restricted to – the bbc in the united kingdom originally financed in a similar method to the british model using consumer licence fees on broadcasting receivers its funding evolved to a projected model approved by the australian parliament in recent times the corporation provides television radio online

abc was a government licensed consortium of private entertainment and content providers authorised under supervision to broadcast on the airwaves using a two-tiered system the a system derived its funds primarily from the licence fees levied on the purchasers of the radio receivers with an emphasis on building the radio wave infrastructure into regional and remote areas whilst the b system relied on privateers and their capacity to establish viable enterprises using the new technology following the general downward economic trends of the era as entrepreneurial ventures in national infrastructure struggled with viability the company was subsequently acquired to become a fully state-owned corporation on 1 july 1932 and renamed as australian broadcasting commission re-aligning more closely to the british bbc model the australian broadcasting corporation act 1983 1 changed the name of the organisation to the australian broadcasting corporation effective 1 july 1983. 1

broadcasting service and eventually establishing offices in each of australia s capital cities 7 8 the abc s perth headquarters in 1937 over the next four years the stations were reformed into a cohesive broadcasting organisation through regular program relays coordinated by a centralised bureaucracy 9 the australian broadcast radio spectrum was constituted of the abc and the commercial sector 9 news broadcasts were initially restricted due to pressure from sir keith murdoch who controlled many australian newspapers however journalists such as frank dixon and john hinde began to subvert the agreements in the late 1930s in 1939, warren denning was appointed to canberra as the first abc political correspondent after murdoch had refused to allow his newspapers to cover a speech by joseph lyons 10 in 1942 the australian broadcasting act was passed giving the abc the power to decide when and in what circumstances political speeches should be broadcast 11 directions from the

stances on political issues and is required to present a range of views with impartiality over the decades accusations of bias at the abc have arisen at different times and various inquiries undertaken reviews of the abc are regularly commissioned and sometimes not released 75 76 a 2004 roy morgan media credibility survey found that media professionals regarded abc radio as the most accurate news source in the country 77 in mid 2013 the university of the sunshine coast released a study of the professional views of journalists slightly over half of respondents expected to vote for either labor or the greens whereas just under a third planned to vote coalition in contrast over 40 of abc journalists would vote for the greens and almost a third labor 78 79 dr rhonda jolly s 2014 abc overview noted that many commentators have argued consistently that there is a left wing bias which dominates abc news and programming and cited a 2005 piece by paul gray that the broadcaster was overly influenced by the narrow middle-class values of the australian secular left and said that while the national broadcaster had at times offended governments of all persuasions it had always adopted a from the left perspective jolly also noted however that supporters of the abc deny claims that the broadcaster is either intentionally or inadvertently biased and that speaking from opposition politicians have praised the abc for its scrutiny of government the paper noted that in december 2013, abc chairman james spigelman called four independent audits a year in response to the frequent allegations of lack of impartiality in news and current affairs 80 in response to one set of criticisms journalist annabel crabb who has worked at the abc commented every single day i see

opposition leader john howard and labor prime minister paul keating howard later wrote i flatly refused to have kerry o brien of the abc moderate the debates because of the way he had handled the second keating-hewson debate in 1993 in which o brien went in to bat for keating 86 howard went on to win that election a decade later the abc media watch program reported that nsw liberal senator concetta fierravanti-wells had written to her constituents to say that the abc had a collective loathing of john howard 87 at the end of the howard government s term in 2007, left-wing political commentator robert manne wrote in the monthly that the howard government had viewed the broadcaster as being run by left-wing ideologues who had supposedly pushed the agenda of the left on issues like refugees the republic multiculturalism reconciliation radical feminism extreme environmentalism anti-americanism gay rights and so on 2 soon after coming to office in 1996, the howard government reduced the abc s operating grants by 10  88 its appointment of jonathan shier to the position of managing director was controversial for his program of budget cuts restructuring and the loss of several high-profile personalities and shows 89 90 shier left the position early on 31 october 2001. 91 7.30 report anchor kerry o brien opposed howard s budget cuts to the abc and describes the appointment of shier as its managing director as a manifestation of the conservative obsession with the abc as a kind of biased left-wing culture  92 in howard s last election he was defeated in the seat of bennelong by labor candidate maxine mckew who had hosted lateline during the howard era 93 peter mares reported for radio national that some wags described it as an internal promotion  while others said she d simply moved from the media wing to the political wing of the alp  mares consulted abc journalist turned nsw liberal mla pru goward who said i have no doubt there was left-wing bias i certainly thought it when i was there  while mckew said there was no left wing bias though what i detected years ago in the abc much more of a collectivist philosophy  94 rudd-gillard-rudd government 2007–2013 edit abc tv s masthead political programs continued to have strong labor party connections through the period in october 2010, the abc announced that former labor staffer kerry o

conservative commentators such as andrew bolt 102 tim blair and gerard henderson 102 accused the abc of a left-wing bias abbott-turnbull government 2013–present edit liberal prime minister tony abbott perceived the abc to be left wing and hostile to his government while his successor malcolm turnbull enjoyed better relations with the national broadcaster when the abc co-operated with the guardian to publish stolen documents purporting to reveal monitoring of indonesian officials by australian spy agencies under the rudd government abbott told 2gb radio a lot of people feel at the moment that the abc instinctively takes everyone s side but australia s  103 104 105 abbott reportedly called the q a program a lefty lynch mob  106 when it invited a man convicted of threatening commonwealth officials to participate in questioning one of his ministers amid a heightened terrorism alert in june 2015, abbott asked the makers of the program whose side are you on  107 108 the abc found that there had been an error of judgement  but repeated the program later in the week prompting abbott to say that heads should roll over the affair 109 abbott initiated a brief ministerial boycott of the q a program following the affair 110 the broadcaster was critical of abbott when he broke an election-eve promise not to make cuts to the abc and required 4.6 cuts over five years as part of his budget repair program 111 112 in early 2015, an internal abc review of its coverage of joe hockey s first budget criticised the post-budget interviews by 7 30 and lateline finding that the

first interview following his toppling of abbott 119 120 in a march 2016 interview with abc managing director mark scott media watch host paul barry examined the question of perceptions of left wing bias at the abc scott noted that while perhaps the abc was more concerned about gay marriage than about electricity prices he did not accept the criticism of bias because a lot of that criticism comes from right wing commentators and they wonder where are the strong right wing commentators on the abc we don t do that kind of journalism we don t ask questions about our journalists voting pattern and where their ideology are we look at the journalism that they put to air and we have strong editorial standards.. 121 following the interview conservative abc critic andrew bolt wrote how can the man heading our biggest media organisation be so blind to the abc s unlawful and dangerous leftist bias while former media watch host jonathan holmes wrote for the age that this interview indicated that abc management had failed to recognise a clear problem of left wing bias among some capital city radio presenters 122 over the period abc tv and radio hosts advocated strongly in support of same-sex marriage upon which the wider australian community and political parties were divided when the turnbull government announced plans for a postal plebiscite on the issue advocacy for change continued
