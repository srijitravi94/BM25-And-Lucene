24-hour english-language news services bbc world news and from bbc.com provided by bbc global news ltd history edit further information timeline of the bbc the birth of british broadcasting 1920 to 1922 edit britain s first live public broadcast from the marconi factory in chelmsford took place in june 1920. it was sponsored by the daily mail s lord northcliffe and featured the famous australian soprano dame nellie melba the melba broadcast caught the people s imagination and marked a turning point in the british public s attitude to radio 16 however this public enthusiasm was not shared in official circles where such broadcasts were held to interfere with important military and civil communications by late 1920, pressure from these quarters and uneasiness among the staff of the licensing authority the general post office gpo  was sufficient to lead to a ban on further chelmsford broadcasts 17 but by 1922, the gpo had received nearly 100 broadcast licence requests 18 and moved to rescind its ban in the wake of a petition by 63 wireless societies with over 3,000 members 19 anxious to avoid the same chaotic expansion experienced in the united states the gpo proposed that it would issue a single broadcasting licence to a company jointly owned by a consortium of leading wireless receiver manufactures to be known as the british broadcasting company ltd john reith a scottish calvinist was appointed its general manager in december 1922 a few weeks after the company made its first official broadcast 20 the company was to be financed by a royalty on the sale of bbc wireless receiving sets from approved manufacturers to this day the bbc aims to follow the reithian directive to inform educate and entertain  21 from private company towards public service corporation 1923 to 1926 edit the financial arrangements soon proved inadequate set sales were disappointing as amateurs made their own receivers and listeners bought rival unlicensed sets 22 by mid-1923 discussions between the gpo and the bbc had become deadlocked and the postmaster-general commissioned a review of broadcasting by the sykes committee the committee recommended a short term reorganisation of licence fees with improved enforcement in order to address the bbc s immediate financial distress and an increased share of the licence revenue split between it and the gpo this was to be followed by a simple 10 shillings licence fee with no royalty once the wireless manufactures protection expired the bbc s broadcasting monopoly was made explicit for the duration of its current broadcast licence as was the prohibition on advertising the bbc was also banned from presenting news bulletins before 19.00, and required to source all news from external wire services mid-1925 found the future of broadcasting under further consideration this time by the crawford committee by now the bbc under reith s leadership had forged a consensus favouring a continuation of the unified monopoly broadcasting service but more money was still required to finance rapid expansion wireless manufacturers were anxious to exit the loss making consortium with reith keen that the bbc be seen as a public service rather than a commercial enterprise the recommendations of the crawford committee were published in march the following year and were still under consideration by the gpo when the 1926 general strike broke out in may the strike temporarily interrupted newspaper production and with restrictions on news bulletins waived the bbc suddenly became the primary source of news for the duration of the crisis 23 the crisis placed the bbc in a delicate position on one hand reith was acutely aware that the government might exercise its right to commandeer the bbc at any time as a mouthpiece of the government if the bbc were to step out of line but on the other he was anxious to maintain public trust by appearing to be acting independently the government was divided on how to handle the bbc but ended up trusting reith whose opposition to the strike mirrored the pm s own thus the bbc was granted sufficient leeway to pursue the government s objectives largely in a manner of its own choosing the resulting coverage of both striker and government viewpoints impressed millions of listeners who were unaware that the pm had broadcast to the nation from reith s home using one of reith s sound bites inserted at the last moment or that the bbc had banned broadcasts from the labour party and delayed a peace appeal by the archbishop of canterbury supporters of the strike nicknamed the bbc the bfc for british falsehood company reith personally announced the end of the strike which he marked by reciting from blake s jerusalem signifying that england had been saved 24 while the bbc tends to characterise its coverage of the general strike by emphasising the positive impression created by its balanced coverage of the views of government and strikers jean seaton professor of media history and the official bbc historian has characterised the episode as the invention of modern propaganda in its british form  23 reith argued that trust gained by authentic impartial news could then be used impartial news was not necessarily an end in itself 25 the bbc did well out of the crisis which cemented a national audience for its broadcasting and it was followed by the government s acceptance of the recommendation made by the crawford committee 1925–26 that the british broadcasting company be replaced by a non-commercial crown-chartered organisation the british broadcasting corporation 1927 to 1939 edit television pioneer john logie baird televised the bbc s first drama the man with the flower in his mouth on 14 july 1930, and the first live outside broadcast the derby on 2 june 1931. 26 27 the british broadcasting corporation came into existence on 1 january 1927, and reith – newly knighted – was appointed its first director general to represent its purpose and stated values the new corporation adopted the coat of arms including the motto nation shall speak peace unto nation  28 british radio audiences had little choice apart from the upscale programming of the bbc reith an intensely moralistic executive was in full charge his goal was to broadcast all that is best in every department of human knowledge endeavour and achievement... the preservation of a high moral tone is obviously of paramount importance 29 reith succeeded in building a high wall against an american-style free-for-all in radio in which the goal was to attract the largest audiences and thereby secure the greatest advertising revenue there was no paid advertising on the bbc all the revenue came from a tax on receiving sets highbrow audiences however greatly enjoyed it 30 at a time when american australian and canadian stations were drawing huge audiences cheering for their local teams with the broadcast of baseball rugby and hockey the bbc emphasized service for a national rather than a regional audience boat races were well covered along with tennis and horse racing but the bbc was reluctant to spend its severely limited air time on long football or cricket games regardless of their popularity 31 bbc versus other media edit george v giving the 1934 royal christmas message on bbc radio the annual message typically chronicles the year s major events the success of broadcasting provoked animosities between the bbc and well established media such as theatres concert halls and the recording industry by 1929, the bbc complained that the agents of many comedians refused to sign contracts for broadcasting because they feared it harmed the artist by making his material stale and that it reduces the value of the artist as a visible music-hall performer  on the other hand the bbc was keenly interested in a cooperation with the recording companies who in recent years . have not been slow to make records of singers orchestras dance bands etc who have already proved their power to achieve popularity by wireless radio plays were so popular that the bbc had received 6,000 manuscripts by 1929, most of them written for stage and of little value for broadcasting day in and day out manuscripts come in and nearly all go out again through the post with a note saying we regret etc 32 in the 1930s music broadcasts also enjoyed great popularity for example the friendly and wide-ranging organ broadcasts at st george s hall langham place by reginald foort who held the official role of bbc staff theatre organist from 1936 to 1938 foort continued to work for the bbc as a freelance into the 1940s and enjoyed a nationwide following experimental television broadcasts were started in 1930, using an electromechanical 30-line system developed by john logie baird limited regular broadcasts using this system began in 1934, and an expanded service now named the bbc television service started from alexandra palace in 1936, alternating between an improved baird mechanical 240 line system and the all electronic 405 line marconi-emi system the superiority of the electronic system saw the mechanical system dropped early the following year 33 1939 to 2001 edit television broadcasting was suspended from 1 september 1939 to 7 june 1946, during the second world war and it was left to bbc radio broadcasters such as reginald foort to keep the nation s spirits up the bbc moved much of its radio operations out of london initially to bristol and then to bedford concerts were broadcast from the corn exchange the trinity chapel in st paul s church bedford was the studio for the daily service from 1941 to 1945 and in the darkest days of the war in 1941, the archbishops of canterbury and york came to st paul s to broadcast to the uk and all parts of the world on the national day of prayer there was a widely reported urban myth that upon resumption of the bbc television service after the war announcer leslie mitchell started by saying as i was saying before we were so rudely interrupted . in fact the first person to appear when transmission resumed was jasmine bligh and the words said were good afternoon everybody how are you do you remember me jasmine bligh . 34 the european broadcasting union was formed on 12 february 1950, in torquay with the bbc among the 23 founding broadcasting organisations 35 bbc television centre at white city west london which opened in 1960 and closed in 2013. competition to the bbc was introduced in 1955, with the commercial and independently operated television network of itv however the bbc monopoly on radio services would persist until 8 october 1973 when under the control of the newly renamed independent broadcasting authority iba the uk s first independent local radio station lbc came on-air in the london area as a result of the pilkington committee report of 1962, in which the bbc was praised for the quality and range of its output and itv was very heavily criticised for not providing enough quality programming 36 the decision was taken to award the bbc a second television channel bbc2 in 1964, renaming the existing service bbc1 bbc2 used the higher resolution 625 line standard which had been standardised across europe bbc2 was broadcast in colour from 1 july 1967, and was joined by bbc1 and itv on 15 november 1969. the 405 line vhf transmissions of bbc1 and itv were continued for compatibility with older television receivers until 1985. starting in 1964, a series of pirate radio stations starting with radio caroline came on the air and forced the british government finally to regulate radio services to permit nationally based advertising-financed services in response the bbc reorganised and renamed their radio channels on 30 september 1967, the light programme was split into radio 1 offering continuous popular music and radio 2 more easy listening  37 the third programme became radio 3 offering classical music and

british sky broadcasting in 2013 14 73 and £1.843 billion for itv in the calendar year 2013. 74 revenue edit see also television licence and television licensing in the united kingdom the principal means of funding the bbc is through the television licence costing £145.50 per year per household since april 2010. such a licence is required to legally receive broadcast television across the uk the channel islands and the isle of man no licence is required to own a television used for other means or for sound only radio sets though a separate licence for these was also required for non-tv households until 1971  the cost of a television licence is set by the government and enforced by the criminal law a discount is available for households with only black-and-white television sets a 50 discount is also offered to people who are registered blind or severely visually impaired 75 and the licence is completely free for any household containing anyone aged 75 or over as a result of the uk government s recent spending review an agreement has been reached between the government and the corporation in which the current licence fee will remain frozen at the current level until the royal charter is renewed at the beginning of 2017. 76 the revenue is collected privately clarification needed and is paid into the central government consolidated fund a process defined in the communications act 2003. the bbc pursues its licence fee collection and enforcement under the trading name tv licensing  tv licensing collection is currently carried out by capita an outside agency funds are then allocated by the department of culture media and sport dcms and the treasury and approved by parliament via legislation additional revenues are paid by the department for work and pensions to compensate for subsidised licences for eligible over-75-year-olds the licence fee is classified as a tax 77 and its evasion is a criminal offence since 1991, collection and enforcement of the licence fee has been the responsibility of the bbc in its role as tv licensing authority 78 thus the bbc is a major prosecuting authority in england and wales and an investigating authority in the uk as a whole the bbc carries out surveillance mostly using subcontractors on properties under the auspices of the regulation of investigatory powers act 2000 and may conduct searches of a property using a search warrant 79 according to the bbc more than 204,000 people in the uk were caught watching tv without a licence during the first six months of 2012. 80 licence fee evasion makes up around one tenth of all cases prosecuted in magistrates courts 81 income from commercial enterprises and from overseas sales of its catalogue of programmes has substantially increased over recent years 82 with bbc worldwide contributing some £145 million to the bbc s core public service business according to the bbc s 2013 14 annual report its total income was £5 billion £5.066 billion  2 which can be broken down as follows £3.726 billion in licence fees collected from householders £1.023 billion from the bbc s commercial businesses £244.6 million from government grants of which £238.5 million is from the foreign and commonwealth office for the bbc world service £72.1 million from other income such as rental collections and royalties from overseas broadcasts of programming 2 the licence fee has however attracted criticism it has been argued that in an age of multi stream multi-channel availability an obligation to pay a licence fee is no longer appropriate the bbc s use of private sector company capita group to send letters to premises not paying the licence fee has been criticised especially as there have been cases where such letters have been sent to premises which are up to date with their payments or do not require a tv licence 83 the bbc uses advertising campaigns to inform customers of the requirement to pay the licence fee past campaigns have been criticised by conservative mp boris johnson and former mp ann widdecombe for having a threatening nature and language used to scare evaders into paying 84 85 audio clips and television broadcasts are used to inform listeners of the bbc s comprehensive database 86 there are a number of pressure groups campaigning on the issue of the licence fee 87 the majority of the bbc s commercial output comes from its commercial arm bbc worldwide who sell programmes abroad and exploit key brands for merchandise of their 2012 13 sales 27 were centred on the five key superbrands of doctor who top gear strictly come

much funding from the television licence meaning that other websites are unable to compete with the vast amount of advertising-free on-line content available on bbc online 130 some have proposed that the amount of licence fee money spent on bbc online should be reduced—either being replaced with funding from advertisements or subscriptions or a reduction in the amount of content available on the site 131 in response to this the bbc carried out an investigation and has now set in motion a plan to change the way it provides its online services bbc online will now attempt to fill in gaps in the market and will guide users to other websites for currently existing market provision for example instead of providing local events information and timetables users will be guided to outside websites

significance edit until the development popularisation and domination of television radio was the broadcast medium upon which people in the united kingdom relied it reached into every home in the land and simultaneously united the nation an important factor during the second world war  141 the bbc introduced the world s first high-definition 405-line television service in 1936. it suspended its television service during the second world war and until 1946, but remained the only television broadcaster in the uk until 1955, when independent television itv began operating 142 this heralded the transformation of television into a popular and dominant medium nevertheless throughout the 1950s radio still remained the dominant source of broadcast comedy  142 further the bbc was the only legal radio broadcaster until 1968 when ury obtained their first licence  143 despite the advent of commercial television and radio the bbc has remained one of the main elements in british popular culture through its obligation to produce tv and radio programmes for mass audiences 144 145 however the arrival of bbc2 allowed the bbc also to make programmes for minority interests in drama documentaries current affairs entertainment and sport examples cited include the television series civilisation doctor who i claudius monty python s flying circus pot black and tonight but other examples can be given in each of these fields as shown by the bbc s entries in the british film institute s 2000 list of the 100 greatest british television programmes 146 the export of bbc programmes both through services like the bbc world service and bbc world news as well as through the channels operated by bbc worldwide means that audiences can consume bbc productions worldwide the term bbc english was used as an alternative name for received pronunciation and the english pronouncing dictionary uses the term bbc pronunciation to label its recommendations 147 however the bbc itself now makes more use of regional accents in order to reflect the diversity of the uk while continuing to expect clarity and fluency of its presenters 148 from its starchy beginnings the bbc has also become more inclusive and now attempts to accommodate the interests of all strata of society and all minorities because they all pay the licence fee 149 competition from independent television channel 4, sky and other broadcast-television stations has lessened the bbc s influence but its public broadcasting remains a major influence on british popular culture 144 attitudes toward the bbc in popular culture edit older domestic uk audiences often refer to the bbc as the beeb  a nickname originally coined by peter sellers on the goon show in the 1950s when he referred to the beeb beeb ceeb  it was then borrowed shortened and popularised by kenny everett 150 another nickname now less commonly used is auntie  said to originate from the old-fashioned auntie knows best attitude or the idea of aunties and uncles who are present in the background of one s life but possibly a reference to the aunties and uncles who presented children s programmes in the early days 151 in the days when john reith the bbc s first director general was in charge the two nicknames have also been used together as auntie beeb  152 criticism and controversies edit main articles criticism of the bbc and bbc controversies the bbc has faced various accusations regarding many topics the iraq war politics ethics and religion as well as funding and staffing it also has been involved in numerous controversies because of its different sometimes controversial coverage of specific news stories and programming in october 2014, the bbc trust issued the bbc complaints framework  153 outlining complaints and appeals procedures however the regulatory oversight of the bbc may be transferred to ofcom the british house of commons select committee on culture media and sport recommended in its report the future of the bbc  154 that ofcom should become the final arbiter of complaints made about the bbc 155 accusations of a bias against the government and the conservative party were often made against the corporation by members of margaret thatcher s 1980s conservative government bbc has long faced accusations of liberal and leftwing bias 156 presenter andrew marr has said that the bbc is not impartial or neutral it has a liberal bias not so much a party-political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias  while former bbc director roger mosey classified it as liberal defensive 157 158 159 conversely the bbc has been criticised by the guardian columnist owen jones who has said that the truth is the bbc is stacked full of rightwingers 160 paul mason the former economics editor of the bbc s newsnight programme has also criticised the bbc as unionist in relation to the bbc s coverage of the 2014 scottish referendum campaign and neo-liberal  161 however peter sissons a main news presenter at the bbc from 1989—2009 who from 1964—1989 worked as a journalist and then senior presenter at itn latterly at channel 4 news says at the core of the bbc in its very dna is a way of thinking that is firmly of the left  162 the bbc has also been characterised as a pro-monarchist institution 163 the bbc was also accused of propaganda by journalist and author toby young due to what he believed to be an anti-brexit approach including a whole day of live programming on migration 164 the bbc world service was involved in the kyrgyz revolution in april 2010. one of the news presenters and a producer of
