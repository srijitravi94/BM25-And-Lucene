dominican republic  northwest of the turks and caicos islands southeast of the us state of florida and east of the florida keys the capital is nassau on the island of new providence the designation of the bahamas can refer either to the country or to the larger island chain that it shares with the turks and caicos islands as stated in the mandate manifesto of the royal bahamas defence force the bahamas territory encompasses 470,000 km2 180,000 sq mi of ocean space the bahamas is the site of columbus first landfall in the new world in 1492. at that time the islands were inhabited by the lucayan a branch of the arawakan-speaking taino people although the spanish never colonised the bahamas they shipped the native lucayans to slavery in hispaniola the islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648, when english colonists from bermuda settled on the island of eleuthera the bahamas became a british crown colony in 1718, when the british clamped down on piracy after the american war of independence the crown resettled thousands of american loyalists in the bahamas they brought their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants africans constituted the majority of the population from this period the slave trade was abolished by the british in 1807 slavery in the bahamas was abolished in 1834. the bahamas became a haven for freed african slaves the royal navy

currently queen elizabeth ii as its head of state in terms of gross domestic product per capita the bahamas is one of the richest countries in the americas following the united states and canada  with an economy based on tourism and finance 12 etymology edit the name bahamas is mostly likely derived from either the taíno ba ha ma big upper middle land  which was a term for the region used by the indigenous native americans 13 or possibly from the spanish baja mar shallow water or sea or low tide reflecting the shallow waters of the area alternatively it may originate from guanahani a local name of unclear meaning 14 a peculiarity of the name is that the word the is a formal part of the abbreviated name and is therefore capitalised so in contrast to the congo and the united kingdom  it

spain in caravels the niña and the pinta on watling island an island of the bahamas that the natives called guanahani and that he named san salvador on 12 october 1492. 15 taino people moved into the uninhabited southern bahamas from hispaniola and cuba around the 11th century having migrated there from south america they came to be known as the lucayan people an estimated 30,000 lucayan inhabited the bahamas at the time of christopher columbus arrival in 1492. columbus s first landfall in the new world was on an island he named san salvador known to the lucayan as guanahani  some researchers believe this site to be present-day san salvador island formerly known as watling s island  situated in the southeastern bahamas an alternative theory holds that columbus landed to the southeast on samana cay according to calculations made in 1986 by national geographic writer and editor joseph judge based on columbus s log evidence in support of this remains inconclusive on the landfall island columbus made first contact with the lucayan and exchanged goods with them the spanish forced much of the lucayan population to hispaniola for use as forced labour the slaves suffered from harsh conditions and most died from contracting diseases to which they had no immunity half of the taino died from smallpox alone 16 the population of the bahamas was severely diminished 17 in 1648, the eleutherian adventurers led by william sayle migrated from bermuda these english puritans established the first permanent european settlement on an island which they named eleuthera—the name derives from the greek word for freedom they later settled new providence naming it sayle s island after one of their leaders to survive the settlers salvaged goods from wrecks in 1670, king charles ii

a crown colony in 1718 under the royal governorship of woodes rogers after a difficult struggle he succeeded in suppressing piracy 19 in 1720, rogers led local militia to drive off a spanish attack during the american war of independence in the late 18th century the islands became a target for american naval forces under the command of commodore esek hopkins us marines occupied the capital of nassau for a fortnight in 1782, following the british defeat at yorktown a spanish fleet appeared off the coast of nassau the city surrendered without a fight spain returned possession of the bahamas to britain the following year under the terms of the treaty of paris before the news was received however the islands were recaptured by a small british force led by andrew deveaux after american independence the british resettled some 7,300 loyalists with their slaves in the bahamas and granted land to the planters to help compensate for losses on the continent these loyalists who included deveaux established plantations on several islands and became a political force in the capital european americans were outnumbered by the african-american slaves they brought with them and ethnic

the home office in london had ruled that any slave brought to the bahamas from outside the british west indies would be manumitted this led to a total of nearly 300 slaves owned by us nationals being freed from 1830 to 1835. 25 the american slave ships comet and encomium used in the united states domestic coastwise slave trade were wrecked off abaco island in december 1830 and february 1834, respectively when wreckers took the masters passengers and slaves into nassau customs officers seized the slaves and british colonial officials freed them over the protests of the americans there were 165 slaves on the comet and 48 on the encomium britain finally paid an indemnity to the united states in those two cases in 1855, under the treaty of claims of 1853, which settled several compensation cases between the two nations 26 27 slavery was abolished in the british empire on 1 august 1834. after that british colonial officials freed 78 american slaves from the enterprise which went into bermuda in 1835 and 38 from the hermosa which wrecked off abaco island in 1840. 28 the most notable case was that of the creole in 1841 as a result of a slave revolt on board the leaders ordered the american brig to nassau it was carrying 135 slaves from virginia destined for sale in new orleans the bahamian officials freed the 128 slaves who chose to stay in the islands the creole case has been described as the most successful slave revolt in u.s history  29 these incidents in which a total of 447 slaves belonging to us nationals were freed from 1830 to 1842, increased tension between the united states and great britain they had been co-operating in patrols to suppress the international slave trade but worried about the stability of its large domestic slave trade and its value the united states argued that britain should not treat its domestic ships that came to its colonial ports under duress as part of the international trade the united states worried that the success of the creole slaves in gaining freedom would encourage more slave revolts on merchant ships 20th century edit edward viii the duke of windsor and governor of the bahamas from 1940 to 1945 in august 1940,

not long after the formation of the north atlantic the 6.4 km thick limestones which predominately make up the bahamas date back to the cretaceous these limestones would have been deposited in shallow seas assumed to be a stretched and thinned portion of the north american continental crust sediments were forming at about the same rate as the crust below was sinking due to the added weight thus the entire area consisted of a large marine plain with some islands then at about 80 ma the area became flooded by the gulf stream this resulted in the drowning of the blake plateau the separation of the bahamas from cuba and florida the separation of the southeastern bahamas into separate banks the creation of the cay sal bank plus the little and great bahama banks sedimentation from the carbonate factory of each bank or atoll continues today at the rate of about 2 cm per kyr coral reefs form the retaining walls of these atolls within which oolites and pellets form 50 coral growth was greater through the tertiary until the start of the ice ages and hence those deposits are more abundant below a depth of 36 m in fact an ancient extinct reef exists half a km seaward of the present one 30 m below sea level oolites form when oceanic water penetrate the shallow banks increasing the temperature about 3 °c and the salinity by 0.5 per cent cemented ooids are referred to as grapestone additionally giant stromatolites are found off the exuma cays 50 22,29–30 sea level changes resulted in a drop in sea level causing wind blown oolite to form sand dunes with distinct cross-bedding overlapping dunes form oolitic ridges which become rapidly lithified through the action of rainwater most islands have ridges ranging from 30 to 45 m though cat island has a ridge 60 m in height the land between ridges is conducive to the formation of lakes and swamps 50 41–59,61–64 solution weathering of the limestone results in a bahamian karst topography this includes potholes blue holes such as dean s blue hole sinkholes beachrock such as the bimini road pavements of atlantis  limestone crust caves due to the lack of rivers and sea caves several blue holes are aligned along the south
