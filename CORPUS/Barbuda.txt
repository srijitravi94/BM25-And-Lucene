sovereign commonwealth nation of antigua and barbuda it is located to the north of antigua in the middle of the leeward islands as of september 2017, due to harsh weather conditions and massive destruction to the infrastructure of the island due to hurricane irma the island of barbuda has been abandoned most of its population of about 1,638 at the 2011 census lived in the town of codrington antigua and barbuda became a sovereign nation on 1 november 1981, but remained part of the british commonwealth and a constitutional monarchy 4 the island has since become a popular tourist destination because of its moderate climate and coastline the location of the island in the tropics makes it vulnerable to atlantic hurricanes in september 2017, hurricane irma caused catastrophic damage on the island it damaged or destroyed 95 of the island s buildings and infrastructure leaving barbuda barely habitable according to prime minister gaston browne everyone on the island was evacuated to antigua leaving barbuda uninhabited for the first time in modern history 5 history edit main article history of antigua and barbuda the ciboney guanahuatebey peoples lived on the island of barbuda during the stone age 6 7 arawak and carib indians populated the island when christopher columbus landed on his second voyage in 1493. early settlements by the spanish and french were succeeded by the english who formed a colony in 1666. in 1685, barbuda was leased to brothers christopher and john codrington who had founded the town of codrington the codrington family also produced food on the land and they transported slaves as labour for their sugarcane plantations on antigua during the 1740s there were multiple rebellions of slaves at codrington during which enslaved people revolted against the people who were enslaving them all slaves were freed in 1834. on 1 november 1981, the island gained its independence as an integral part of antigua and barbuda a member of the commonwealth of nations in a 1989 election the barbuda independence movement received too few votes to qualify for a seat in the national parliament slavery edit there is a widespread belief shared by some barbudans that the codringtons set up a human stock farm on barbuda for the purpose of breeding the strongest tallest enslaved people 8 9 an article in the annals of the new york academy of science has disputed this stating that the codringtons considered using barbuda as a nursery where slave children would have been raised to later work on antiguan plantations but this plan was also never realized 10 other sources indicate that slaves were in fact an export commodity 11 but this was probably due to natural population growth no new slaves had arrived on the island since the mid 1700s 12 in any event the island was certainly an exporter of slaves an estimate in 1977 by lowenthal and clark indicated that during 1779 to 1834 the number of slaves exported totalled 172 most were taken to antigua but 37 went to the leeward and windward islands and some to the southern us several slave rebellions took place on the island with the most serious in 1834–5 13 britain emancipated slaves in most of its colonies in 1834, but that did not include barbuda so the island then freed its own slaves for some years thereafter the freed slaves had little opportunity of survival on their own because of limited agricultural land and the lack of available credit to buy some hence they continued to work on the plantations for nominal wages or lived in shantytowns and worked as occasional labourers 14 sugar cane production remained the primary economy for over a century effective trade unions were not formed until the 1930s 12 the first map of barbuda was made in the second half of the 18th century at that time there were substantial buildings in the highland area a castle in codrington a fort at river now known as the martello tower and houses at palmetto point coco point and castle hill the map shows eight catching pens for holding captured runaway slaves indicating that this was a serious problem there were several defensive cannon gun battery units around the island perimeter there was a large plantation in the meadow and guava area and another large plantation in the highlands area 13 natural disasters edit satellite images of antigua and barbuda from august 21,
