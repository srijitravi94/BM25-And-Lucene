sanskrit वङ्गसागर lit bengal sea and purvapayodhi sanskrit पूर्वपयोधि lit eastern ocean  even today in bengali it is known as bongoposagor  rivers edit many major rivers of india flow west to east before draining into the bay of bengal the ganga is the northernmost of these its main channel enters and flows through bangladesh where it is known as the padma river before joining the meghna river however the brahmaputra river flows from east to west in assam before turning south and entering bangladesh where it is called the jamuna river this joins the padma where upon the padma joins the meghna river that finally drains into bay of bengal the sundarbans mangrove of forest of bangladesh is a forest at the delta of the padma jamuna and meghna rivers lies partly in west bengal and mostly in bangladesh the brahmaputra at 2,948 km 1,832 mi is the 28th longest river in the world it originates in tibet the hooghly river another channel of the ganga that flows through calcutta drains into bay of bengal the padma–meghna-jamuna rivers deposit nearly 1000 million tons of sediment per year the sediment from these three rivers form the bengal delta and the submarine fan a vast structure that extends from bangladesh to south of the equator is up to 16.5 kilometres 10.3 mi thick and contains at least 1,130 trillion tonnes of sediment which has accumulated over the last 17 million years at an average rate of 665 million tons per annum 7 the bay of bengal used to be deeper than the mariana trench the present deepest ocean point citation needed the fan has buried organic carbon at a rate of nearly 1.1 trillion mol yr 13.2 million t yr since the early miocene period the three rivers currently contribute nearly 8 of the total organic carbon toc deposited in the world s oceans due to high toc accumulation in the deep sea bed of the bay of bengal the area is rich in oil and natural gas and gas hydrate reserves bangladesh can reclaim land substantially and economically gain from the sea area by constructing sea dikes bunds causeways and by trapping the sediment from its rivers further southwest of bangladesh the mahanadi godavari krishna and kaveri rivers also flow from west to east in south asia and drain into the bay of bengal many small rivers also drain directly into the bay of bengal the shortest of them is the cooum river at 64 km 40 mi  the irrawaddy or ayeyarwady

underneath the bay of bengal which is part of the great indo-australian plate and is slowly moving north east this plate meets the burma microplate at the sunda trench the nicobar islands and the andaman islands are part of the burma microplate the india plate subducts beneath the burma plate at the sunda trench or java trench here the pressure of the two plates on each other increase pressure and temperature resulting in the formation of volcanoes such as the volcanoes in myanmar and a volcanic arc called the sunda arc the sumatra-andaman earthquake and asian tsunami was a result of the pressure at this zone causing a submarine earthquake which then resulted in a destructive tsunami 11 marine geology edit a zone 50 m wide extending from the island of ceylon and the coromandel coast

adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed december 2012 learn how and when to remove this template message a transboundary issue is defined as an environmental problem in which either the cause of the problem and or its impact is separated by a national boundary or the problem contributes to a global environmental problem and finding regional solutions is considered to be a global environmental benefit the eight bay of bengal countries have 2012 identified three major transboundary problems or areas of concern affecting the health of the bay that they can work on together with the support of the bay of bengal large marine ecosystem project boblme  the eight countries are now 2012 developing responses to these issues and their causes for future implementation as the strategic action programme overexploitation of fisheries edit some small fishing boats are catching fish sell them in local coastal markets fisheries production in the bay of bengal is six million tonnes per year more than seven percent of the world s catch the major transboundary issues relating to shared fisheries are a decline in the overall availability of fish resources changes in species composition of catches the high proportion of juvenile fish in the catch and changes in marine biodiversity especially through loss of vulnerable and endangered species the transboundary nature of these issues are that many fish stocks are shared between boblme countries through the transboundary migration of fish or larvae fishing overlaps national jurisdictions both legally and illegally – overcapacity and overfishing in one location forces a migration of fishers and vessels to other locations all countries to a greater or lesser degree are experiencing difficulties in implementing fisheries management especially the ecosystem approach to fisheries bay of bengal countries contribute significantly to the global problem of loss of vulnerable and endangered species the main causes of the issues are open access to fishing grounds government emphasis on increasing fish catches inappropriate government subsidies provided to fishers increasing fishing effort especially from trawlers and purse seiners high consumer demand for fish including for seed and fishmeal for aquaculture ineffective fisheries management and illegal and destructive fishing degradation of critical habitats edit the bay of bengal is an area of high biodiversity with many endangered and vulnerable species the major transboundary issues relating to habitats are the loss and degradation of mangrove habitats degradation of coral reefs and the loss of and damage to seagrasses the transboundary nature of these major issues are that all three critical habitats occur in all boblme countries coastal development for several varying uses of the land and sea are common in all boblme countries trade in products from all the habitats is transboundary in nature climate change impacts are shared by all boblme countries the main causes of the issues are food security needs of the coastal poor lack of coastal development plans increasing trade in products from coastal habitats coastal development and industrialization ineffective marine protected areas and lack of enforcement upstream development that affects water-flow intensive upstream agricultural practices and increasing tourism pollution and water quality edit the major transboundary issues relating to pollution and water quality are sewage-borne pathogens and organic load solid waste marine litter increasing nutrient inputs oil pollution persistent organic pollutants pops and persistent toxic substances ptss sedimentation and heavy metals the transboundary nature of these issues are discharge of untreated partially treated sewage being a common problem sewage and organic discharges from the ganges-brahmaputra-meghna river are likely to be transboundary plastics and derelict fishing gear can be transported long distances across national boundaries high nutrient discharges from rivers could intensify largescale hypoxia atmospheric transport of nutrients is inherently transboundary differences between countries with regard to regulation and enforcement of shipping discharges may drive discharges across boundaries tar balls are transported long distances pops ptss and mercury including organo-mercury undergo long-range transport sedimentation and most heavy metal contamination tend to be localized and lack a strong transboundary dimension the main causes of the issues are increasing coastal population density and urbanization higher consumption resulting in more waste generated per person insufficient funds allocated to waste management migration of industry into boblme countries and proliferation of small industries history edit ross island in the andamans was one of the main naval bases of british india during world war ii northern circars occupied the
