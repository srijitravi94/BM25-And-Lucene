weather weather forecasting weather portal v t e a blizzard is a severe snowstorm characterized by strong sustained winds of at least 35 mph 56 km h and lasting for a prolonged period of time—typically three hours or more a ground blizzard is a weather condition where snow is not falling but loose snow on the ground is lifted and blown by strong winds blizzard into tochal skiing resort tehran and involved skiers definition and etymology edit in the united states the national weather service defines a blizzard as a severe snow storm characterized by strong winds causing blowing snow that results in low visibilities the difference between a blizzard and a snowstorm is the strength of the wind not the amount of snow to be a blizzard a snow storm must have sustained winds or frequent gusts that are greater than or equal to 56 km h 35 mph with blowing or drifting snow which reduces visibility to 400 m or 0.25 mi or less and must last for a prolonged period of time—typically three hours or more 1 2 while severe cold and large amounts of drifting snow may accompany blizzards they are not required blizzards can bring whiteout conditions and can paralyze regions for days at a time particularly where snowfall is unusual or rare a severe blizzard has winds over 72 km h 45 mph  near zero visibility and temperatures of −12 °c 10 °f or lower 3 in antarctica blizzards are associated with winds spilling over the edge of the ice plateau at an average velocity of 160 km h 99 mph  3 ground blizzard refers to a weather condition where loose snow or ice on the ground is lifted and blown by strong winds the primary difference between a ground blizzard as opposed to a regular blizzard is that in a ground blizzard no precipitation is produced at the time but rather all the precipitation is already present in the form of snow or ice at the surface drifted snow near burrow-with-burrow lancashire england january 1963 the australia bureau of meteorology describes a blizzard as violent and very cold wind which is laden with snow some part at least of which has been raised from snow covered ground 4 the oxford english dictionary concludes the term blizzard is likely onomatopoeic derived from the same sense as blow blast blister and bluster the first recorded use of it for weather dates to 1829, when it was defined as a violent blow  it achieved its modern definition by 1859, when it was in use in the western united states the term became common in the press during the harsh winter of 1880–81 5 united states storm systems edit duluth minnesota blizzard march 2007 march blizzard in north dakota 1966. in the united states storm systems powerful enough to cause blizzards usually form when the jet stream dips far to the south allowing cold dry polar air from the north to clash with warm humid air moving up from the south 2 6 they are most common in the great plains the great lakes states and the northeastern states along the coast and less common in the pacific northwest when cold moist air from the pacific ocean moves eastward to the rocky mountains and the great plains and warmer moist air moves north from the gulf of mexico all that is needed is a movement of cold polar air moving south to form potential blizzard conditions that may extend from the texas panhandle to the great lakes another storm system occurs when a cold core low over the hudson bay area in canada is displaced southward over southeastern canada the great lakes and new england when the rapidly moving cold front collides with warmer air coming north from the gulf of mexico strong surface winds significant cold air advection and extensive wintry precipitation occur conditions approaching a blizzard whiteout in minnesota on march 1, 2007. note the unclear horizon near the center low pressure systems moving out of the rocky mountains onto the great plains a broad expanse of flat land much of it covered in prairie steppe and grassland can cause thunderstorms and rain to the south and heavy snows and strong winds to the north with few trees or other obstructions to reduce wind and blowing this part of the country is particularly vulnerable to blizzards with very low temperatures and whiteout conditions in a true whiteout there is no visible horizon people can become lost in their own front yards when the door is only 3 m 10 ft away and they would have to feel their way back motorists have to stop their cars where they are as the road is impossible to see nor easter blizzards edit illustration of the great blizzard of 1888 a nor easter is a macro-scale storm along the upper east coast of the united states and atlantic canada it gets its name from the direction the wind is coming from the usage of the term in north america comes from the wind associated with many different types of storms some of which can form in the north atlantic ocean and some of which form as far south as the gulf of mexico the term is most often used in the coastal areas of new england and atlantic canada this type of storm has characteristics similar to a hurricane more specifically it describes a low-pressure area whose center of rotation is just off the east coast and whose leading winds in the left-forward quadrant rotate onto land from the northeast high storm waves may sink ships at sea and cause coastal flooding and beach erosion notable nor easters include the great blizzard of 1888, one of the worst blizzards in u.s history it dropped 100–130 cm 40–50 in of snow and had sustained winds of more than 45 miles per hour

cold the chicago and north western railway stopping trains until the spring thaw because the snow made the tracks impassable the near-starvation of the townspeople and the courage of her future husband almanzo and another man who ventured out on the open prairie in search of a cache of wheat that no one was even sure existed the october blizzard brought snowfalls so deep that two-story homes had snow up to the second floor windows no one was prepared for the deep snow so early in the season and farmers all over the region were caught before their crops had even been harvested their grain milled or with their fuel supplies for the winter in place by january the train service was almost entirely suspended from the region railroads hired scores of men to dig out the tracks but it was a wasted effort as soon as they had finished shoveling a stretch of line a new storm arrived filling up the line and leaving their work useless there were no winter thaws and on february 2, 1881, a second massive blizzard struck that lasted for nine days in the towns the streets were filled with solid drifts to the tops of the buildings and tunneling was needed to secure passage about town homes and barns were completely covered compelling farmers to tunnel to reach and feed their stock when the snow finally melted in late spring of 1881, huge sections of the plains were flooded massive ice jams clogged the missouri river and when they broke the downstream areas were ravaged most of the town of yankton in what is now south dakota was washed away when the river overflowed its banks 10 11
