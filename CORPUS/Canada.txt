to form the semi-autonomous federal dominion named canada this began an accretion of provinces and territories to the dominion to the present ten provinces and three territories forming contemporary

cooperation forum etymology main article name of canada while a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of canada the name is now accepted as coming from the st lawrence iroquoian word kanata meaning village or settlement  12 in 1535, indigenous inhabitants of the present-day quebec city region used the word to direct french explorer jacques cartier to the village of stadacona 13 cartier later used the word canada to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to donnacona the chief at stadacona 13 by 1545, european books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the saint lawrence river as canada 13 from the 16th to the early 18th century canada referred to the part of new france that lay along the saint lawrence river 14 in 1791, the area became two british colonies called upper canada and lower canada collectively named the canadas until their union as the british province of canada in 1841. 15 upon confederation in 1867, canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the london conference and the word dominion was conferred as the country s title 16 the transition away from the use of dominion was formally reflected in 1982 with the passage of the canada act which refers only to canada later that year the name of the national holiday was changed from dominion day to canada day 17 the term dominion is also used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces though after the second world war the term federal had replaced dominion 18 history main article history of canada see also timeline of canadian history and list of years in canada further information historiography of canada indigenous peoples linguistic areas of north american indigenous peoples at the time of european contact indigenous peoples in present-day canada include the first nations inuit and métis 19 the latter being a mixed-blood people who originated in the mid-17th century when first nations and inuit people married european settlers 19 the term aboriginal as a collective noun is a specific term of art used in some legal documents including the constitution act 1982. 20 the first inhabitants of north america are generally hypothesized to have migrated from siberia by way of the bering land bridge 21 and arrived at least 15,000 years ago though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival 22 23 24 25 the paleo-indian archeological sites at old crow flats and bluefish caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in canada 26 the characteristics of canadian indigenous societies included permanent settlements agriculture complex societal hierarchies and trading networks 27 28 some of these cultures had collapsed by the time european explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations 29 the indigenous population at the time of the first european settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000 30 and two million 31 with a figure of 500,000 accepted by canada s royal commission on aboriginal peoples 32 as a consequence of european colonization the population of canada s indigenous peoples declined by forty to eighty percent and several first nations such as the beothuk disappeared 33 the decline is attributed to several causes including the transfer of european diseases such as influenza measles and smallpox to which they had no natural immunity 30 34 conflicts over the fur trade conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers and the loss of indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations self-sufficiency 35 36 although not without conflict european canadians early interactions with first nations and inuit populations were relatively peaceful 37 first nations and métis peoples played a critical part in the development of european colonies in canada particularly for their role in assisting european coureur des bois and voyageurs in the exploration of the continent during the north american fur trade 38 the crown and indigenous peoples began interactions during the european colonization period though the inuit in general had more limited interaction with european settlers 39 however from the late 18th century european canadians encouraged indigenous peoples to assimilate into their own culture 40 these attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration and relocations 41 a period of redress is underway which started with the appointment of the truth and reconciliation commission of canada by the government of canada in 2008. 42 european colonization the first known attempt at european colonization began when norsemen settled briefly at l anse aux meadows in newfoundland around 1000 ad 43 no further european exploration occurred until 1497, when italian seafarer john cabot explored and claimed canada s atlantic coast in the name of king henry vii of england 44 45 then basque and portuguese mariners established seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the atlantic coast in the early 16th century 46 in 1534, french explorer jacques cartier explored the gulf of saint lawrence where on july 24, he planted a 10-metre 33 ft cross bearing the words long live the king of france and took possession of the territory new france in the name of king francis i 47 in general the settlements appear to have been short-lived possibly due to the similarity of outputs producible in scandinavia and northern canada and the problems of navigating trade routes at that time 48 in 1583, sir humphrey gilbert by the royal prerogative of queen elizabeth i founded st john s newfoundland as the first north american english colony 49 french explorer samuel de champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent european settlements at port royal in 1605 and quebec city in 1608  50 among the colonists of new france canadiens extensively settled the saint lawrence river valley and acadians settled the present-day maritimes while fur traders and catholic missionaries explored the great lakes hudson bay and the mississippi watershed to louisiana 51 the beaver wars broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the north american fur trade 52 benjamin west s the death of general wolfe 1771 dramatizes james wolfe s death during the battle of the plains of abraham at quebec the english established additional settlements in newfoundland beginning in 1610 53 and the thirteen colonies to the south were founded soon after 46 a series of four wars erupted in colonial north america between 1689 and 1763 the later wars of the period constituted the north american theatre of the seven years war 54 mainland nova scotia came under british rule with the 1713 treaty of utrecht and canada and most of new france came under british rule in 1763 after the seven years war 55 the royal proclamation of 1763 established first nation treaty rights created the province of quebec out of new france and annexed cape breton island to nova scotia 17 st john s island now prince edward island became a separate colony in 1769. 56 to avert conflict in quebec the british parliament passed the quebec act of 1774, expanding quebec s territory to the great lakes and ohio valley more importantly the quebec act afforded quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time that the thirteen colonies were increasingly agitating against british rule 57 it re-established the french language catholic faith and french civil law there staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the thirteen colonies the proclamation and the quebec act in turn angered many residents of the thirteen colonies further fuelling anti-british sentiment in the years prior to the american revolution 17 after the successful american war of independence the 1783 treaty of paris recognized the independence of the newly formed united state and set the terms of peace ceding british north american territories south of the great lakes to the new country 58 the american war of independence also caused a large out-migration of loyalists the settlers who had fought against american independence many moved to canada particularly atlantic canada where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories new brunswick was in turn split from nova scotia as part of a reorganization of loyalist settlements in the maritimes 59 to accommodate the influx of english-speaking loyalists in central canada the constitutional act of 1791 divided the province of canada into french-speaking lower canada later quebec and english-speaking upper canada later ontario  granting each its own elected legislative assembly 60 the canadas were the main front in the war of 1812 between the united states and the united kingdom peace came in 1815 no boundaries were changed immigration resumed at a higher level with over 960,000 arrivals from britain between 1815–50 61 new arrivals included refugees escaping the great irish famine as well as gaelic-speaking scots displaced by the highland clearances 62 infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of europeans who immigrated to canada before 1891. 30 the desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive rebellions of 1837. 63 the durham report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of french canadians into english culture 17 the act of union merged the canadas into a united province of canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of british north america by 1849. 64 the signing of the oregon treaty by britain and the united states in 1846 ended the oregon boundary dispute extending the border westward along the 49th parallel this paved the way for british colonies on vancouver island 1849 and in british columbia 1858  65 in 1867, the same year as canadian confederation britain declined to purchase for canada the alaska territory that was to that point tenuously held by russia with the united states purchasing alaska instead clearly demarcated borders for canada although there would continue to be some disputes about the exact demarkation of the alaska-yukon and alaska-bc border for years to come 66 confederation and expansion an animated map showing the growth and change of canada s provinces and territories since confederation in 1867 following several constitutional conferences the constitution act officially proclaimed canadian confederation on july 1, 1867, initially with four provinces ontario quebec nova scotia and new brunswick 67 68 canada assumed control of rupert s land and the north-western territory to form the northwest territories where the métis grievances ignited the red river rebellion and the creation of the province of manitoba in july 1870. 69 british columbia and vancouver island which had been united in 1866 joined the confederation in 1871, while prince edward island joined in 1873. 70 to open the west to european immigration parliament also approved sponsoring the construction of three transcontinental railways including the canadian pacific railway  opening the prairies to settlement with the dominion lands act and establishing the north-west mounted police to assert its authority over this territory 71 72 in 1898, during the klondike gold rush in the northwest territories parliament created the yukon territory alberta and saskatchewan became provinces in 1905. 70 early 20th century canadian soldiers and a mark ii tank at the battle of vimy ridge in 1917 because britain still maintained control of canada s foreign affairs under the confederation act its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought canada into world war i 73 volunteers sent to the western front later became part of the canadian corps which played a substantial role in the battle of vimy ridge and other major engagements of the war 74 out of approximately 625,000 canadians who served in world war i some 60,000 were killed and another 172,000 were wounded 75 the conscription crisis of 1917 erupted when the unionist cabinet s proposal to augment the military s dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from french-speaking quebecers 76 the military service act brought in compulsory military service though it coupled with disputes over french language schools outside quebec deeply alienated francophone canadians and temporarily split the liberal party 76 in 1919, canada joined the league of nations independently of britain 74 and the 1931 statute of westminster affirmed canada s independence 4 canadian crew of a sherman tank south of vaucelles france during the battle of normandy in june 1944 the great depression in canada during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn leading to hardship

government in 1934 and become a crown colony ruled by a british governor 82 after two bitter referendums newfoundlanders voted to join canada in 1949 as a province 83 canada s post-war economic growth combined with the policies of successive liberal governments led to the emergence of a new canadian identity marked by the adoption of the maple leaf flag in 1965, 84 the implementation of official bilingualism english and french in 1969, 85 and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971. 86 socially democratic programs were also instituted such as medicare the canada pension plan and

referendum on sovereignty-association in 1980. attempts to accommodate quebec nationalism constitutionally through the meech lake accord failed in 1990. 96 this led to the formation of the bloc québécois in quebec and the invigoration of the reform party of canada in the west 97 98 a second referendum followed in 1995, in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent 99 in 1997, the supreme court ruled that unilateral secession by a province would be unconstitutional and the clarity act was passed by parliament outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from confederation 96 in addition to the issues of quebec sovereignty a number of crises shook canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s these included the explosion of air india flight 182
