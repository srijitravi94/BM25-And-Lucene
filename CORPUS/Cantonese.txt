its vicinity in southeastern china it is the traditional prestige variety of yue one of the major subdivisions of chinese in mainland china it is the lingua franca of the province of guangdong being the majority language of the pearl river delta and neighbouring areas such as guangxi it is the dominant and official language of hong kong and macau cantonese is also widely spoken amongst overseas chinese in southeast asia most notably in vietnam and malaysia as well as in singapore and cambodia to a lesser extent and throughout the western world while the term cantonese refers narrowly to the prestige variety it is often used in a broader sense for the entire yue subdivision of chinese including related but largely mutually unintelligible languages such as taishanese when cantonese and the closely related yuehai dialects are classified together there are about 80 million total speakers 3 cantonese is viewed as a vital part of the cultural identity for its native speakers across large swaths of southeastern china hong kong and macau although cantonese shares some vocabulary with mandarin the two varieties are mutually unintelligible because of differences in pronunciation grammar and lexicon sentence structure in particular the placement of verbs sometimes differs between the two varieties a notable difference between cantonese and mandarin is how the spoken word is written both can be recorded verbatim but very few cantonese speakers are knowledgeable in the full cantonese written vocabulary so a non-verbatim formalised written form is adopted which is more akin to the mandarin written form 4 5 this results in the situation in which a cantonese and a mandarin text may look similar but are pronounced differently names edit in english the term cantonese is ambiguous cantonese proper is the variety native to the city of canton which is the traditional english name of guangzhou this narrow sense may be specified as canton language or guangzhou language in english 6 however cantonese may also refer to the primary branch of cantonese that contains cantonese proper as well as taishanese and gaoyang this broader usage may be specified as yue s粤 t粵  in this article cantonese is used for cantonese proper historically speakers called this variety canton speech or guangzhou speech 广州话 廣州話 gwóngjāu wá  although this term is now seldom used outside mainland china in guangdong province people also call it provincial capital speech 省城话 省城話 sáangsìng wá or plain speech 白话 白話 baahk wá in hong kong and macau as well as among overseas chinese communities the language is referred to as guangdong speech 广东话 廣東話 gwóngdūng wá or simply chinese chinese 中文 cantonese yale jūngmán  7 8 in mainland china the term guangdong speech is also increasingly being used among both native and non-native speakers given the history of the development of yue dialects during the tang dynasty migrations to the region in overseas chinese communities it is also referred to as 唐話 given that people refer to themselves as 唐人 due to its status as a prestige dialect among all the dialects of the yue branch of chinese varieties it is often called standard cantonese 标准粤语 標準粵語 bīujéun yuhtyúh  geographic distribution edit hong kong and macau edit see also hong kong cantonese the official languages of hong kong are chinese and english as defined in the hong kong basic law 9 the chinese language has many different varieties of which cantonese is one given the traditional predominance of cantonese within hong kong it is the de facto official spoken form of the chinese language used in the hong kong government and all courts and tribunals it is also used as the medium of instruction in schools alongside english a similar situation also exists in neighboring macau where chinese is an official language along with portuguese as in hong kong cantonese is the predominant spoken variety of chinese used in everyday life and is thus the official form of chinese used in the government the cantonese spoken in hong kong and macau is mutually intelligible with the cantonese spoken in the mainland city of guangzhou although there exist some minor differences in accent pronunciation and vocabulary china edit distribution of yue chinese languages in southeastern china standard cantonese and closely related dialects are highlighted in pink cantonese first developed around the port city of guangzhou in the pearl river delta region of southeastern china due to the city s long standing as an important cultural center cantonese emerged as the prestige dialect of the yue varieties of chinese in the southern song dynasty and its usage spread around most of what is now the provinces of guangdong and guangxi 10 despite the cession of macau to portugal in 1557 and hong kong to britain in 1842, the ethnic chinese population of the two territories largely originated from the 19th and 20th century immigration from guangzhou and surrounding areas making cantonese the prominent chinese language in the territories on the mainland cantonese continued to serve as the lingua franca of guangdong and guangxi provinces even after mandarin was made the official language of the government by the qing dynasty in the early 1900s 11 cantonese remained the dominant and influential language in southeastern china until the establishment of the people s republic of china in 1949 and its promotion of standard chinese as the sole official language of the nation throughout the last half of the 20th century although its influence is still strong in the region 12 while the chinese government discourages the use of all forms of chinese except standard chinese cantonese enjoys a relatively higher standing than other chinese languages with its own media and usage in public transportation in guangdong province 13 furthermore it is also a medium of instruction in select academic curricula including some university elective courses and chinese as a foreign language programs 14 15 the permitted usage of cantonese in mainland china is largely a countermeasure against hong kong s influence as the autonomous territory has the right to freedom of the press and speech and its cantonese-language media have a substantial exposure and following in guangdong 16 nevertheless the place of local cantonese language and culture remains contentious a 2010 proposal to switch some programming on guangzhou television from cantonese to mandarin was abandoned following massive public protests the largest since the tiananmen square protests of 1989. as a major economic center of china there have been recent concerns that the use of cantonese in guangzhou is diminishing in favour of mandarin both through the continual influx of mandarin-speaking migrants from poorer areas and strict government policies as a result cantonese is being given a more important status by the natives than ever before as a common identity of the local people 17 southeast asia edit cantonese has historically served as a lingua franca among overseas chinese in southeast asia who speak a variety of other forms of chinese including hokkien teochew and hakka 18 additionally cantonese media and pop culture from hong kong is popular throughout the region vietnam edit see also hoa people in vietnam cantonese is the dominant language of the ethnic chinese community usually referred to as hoa which numbers about one million people and constitutes one of the largest minority groups in the country 19 over half of the ethnic chinese population in vietnam speaks cantonese as a native language and the variety also serves as a lingua franca between the different chinese dialect groups many speakers reflect their exposure to vietnamese with a vietnamese accent or a tendency to code-switch between cantonese and vietnamese 20 malaysia edit see also malaysian chinese § cantonese in malaysia cantonese is widely spoken amongst the malaysian chinese community in the capital city of kuala lumpur 21 and the surrounding areas in the klang valley petaling jaya ampang cheras shah alam kajang bangi selayang and subang jaya with a small minority in the town of klang  the dialect is also widely spoken in the state of perak especially in the state capital city of ipoh as well as in the eastern sabahan town of sandakan although hokkien is the most spoken variety of chinese and mandarin is the medium of education at chinese-language schools cantonese is largely influential in the local chinese-language media and is used in commerce by chinese malaysians 22 due to the popularity of hong kong popular culture especially through drama series and popular music cantonese is widely understood by the chinese in all parts of malaysia even though a large proportion of the chinese malaysian population is non-cantonese television networks in malaysia regularly broadcast hong kong television programmes in their original cantonese audio and soundtrack cantonese radio is also available in the nation and cantonese is prevalent in locally produced chinese television 23 24 singapore edit see also chinese singaporeans and languages of singapore in singapore mandarin is the official variety of the chinese language used by the government which has a speak mandarin campaign smc seeking to actively promote the use of mandarin over other chinese varieties cantonese is spoken by a little over 15 of chinese households in singapore despite the government s active promotion of smc the cantonese-speaking chinese community has had relative success in preserving its language against mandarin compared to other dialect groups 25 notably all nationally produced non-mandarin chinese tv and radio programs were stopped after 1979. 26 the prime minister lee kuan yew then also stopped giving speeches in hokkien to prevent giving conflicting signals to the people 26 hong kong cantonese and taiwanese dramas are unavailable in their untranslated form on free-to-air television though drama series in non-chinese languages are available in their original languages cantonese drama series on terrestrial tv channels are instead dubbed in mandarin and broadcast without the original cantonese audio and soundtrack however originals may be available through other sources such as cable television and online videos furthermore an offshoot of smc is the translation to hanyu pinyin of certain terms which originated from southern chinese varieties for instance dim sum is often known as diǎn xīn in singapore s english-language media though this is largely a matter of style and most singaporeans will refer to it as dim sum when speaking english 27 nevertheless since the government restriction on media in non-mandarin varieties was relaxed in the mid-1990s and 2000s the presence of cantonese in singapore has grown substantially forms of popular culture from hong kong such as television series cinema and pop music have become popular in singaporean society and non-dubbed original versions of the media became widely available consequently there has been a large of number of non-cantonese chinese singaporeans being able to understand or speak cantonese to some varying extent with a number of educational institutes offering cantonese as an elective language course 28 cambodia edit cantonese is widely used as the inter-communal language among chinese cambodians especially in phnom penh and other urban areas while teochew speakers form the majority of the chinese population in cambodia cantonese is often used as a vernacular in commerce and with other chinese variant groups in the nation 29 chinese-language schools in cambodia are conducted in both cantonese and mandarin but it always depends on the school 30 thailand edit thailand is home to the largest overseas chinese community in the world numbering over 9 million individuals cantonese is the fourth most-spoken variety of chinese in thai chinese households after teochew hakka and hainanese 31 however within the thai chinese commercial sector it serves as a common language alongside teochew or thai chinese-language schools in thailand have also traditionally been conducted in cantonese furthermore cantonese serves as the lingua franca with other chinese communities in the nation 32 indonesia edit see also indonesian chinese § language in indonesia cantonese is locally known as konghu and is one of the variants spoken by the chinese indonesian community with speakers largely concentrated in major cities such as jakarta the capital city  medan and batam however it has a relatively minor presence compared to other southeast asian nations being the fourth most spoken chinese variety after hokkien hakka and teochew 33 north america edit united states edit street in chinatown san francisco cantonese has traditionally been the dominant chinese variant among chinese populations in the western world over a period of 150 years guangdong has been the place-of-origin for most chinese emigrants to western nations one coastal county taishan or tóisàn where the sìyì or sei yap variety of yue is spoken  alone may be the origin of the vast majority of chinese immigrants to the u.s before 1965. 34 as a result yue languages such as cantonese and the closely related variety of taishanese have been the major chinese varieties traditionally spoken in the united states the zhongshan variant of cantonese with origins in the western pearl river delta is spoken by many chinese immigrants in hawaii and some in san francisco and the sacramento river delta see locke california it is a yuehai variety much like guangzhou cantonese but has flatter tones chinese is the third most widely spoken non-english language in the united states when both cantonese and mandarin are combined behind spanish and french 35 many institutes of higher education have traditionally had chinese programs based on cantonese with some continuing to offer these programs despite the rise of mandarin the most popular romanization for learning cantonese in the united states is yale romanization the majority of chinese emigrants have traditionally originated from guangdong and guangxi as well as hong kong and macao beginning in the latter half of the 20th century and before the handover and southeast asia with cantonese as their native language however more recent immigrants are arriving from the rest of mainland china and taiwan and most often speak standard mandarin putonghua as their native language 36 37 although some may also speak their native local variety such as shanghainese hokkien fuzhounese hakka etc as a result mandarin is becoming more common among the chinese american community the increase of mandarin-speaking communities has resulted in the rise of separate neighborhoods or enclaves segregated by the primary chinese variety spoken socioeconomic statuses are also a factor as well 38 for example in new york city cantonese still predominates in the city s older traditional western portion of chinatown in manhattan in brooklyn s small new chinatowns in sections of bensonhurst and in homecrest the newly emerged little fuzhou eastern portion of manhattan s chinatown and brooklyn s main large chinatown in and around sunset park are mostly populated by fuzhounese speakers who often speak mandarin as well the cantonese and fuzhounese enclaves in new york city are more working class flushing s large chinatown which now holds the crown as the largest chinatown of the city and elmhurst s smaller chinatown in queens are very mixed with large numbers of mandarin speakers from many different parts of china and taiwan they comprise the primary cultural center for new york city s chinese population and are more middle class 39 in northern california especially in the san francisco bay area cantonese has historically and continues to predominate in the chinatowns of san francisco and oakland as well as the surrounding suburbs and metropolitan area although mandarin is now when also found in silicon valley in contrast southern california hosts a much larger mandarin-speaking population with cantonese found in more historical chinese communities such as that of chinatown los angeles and older chinese ethnoburbs such as san gabriel rosemead and temple city 40 while a number of more-established taiwanese immigrants have learned cantonese to foster relations with the traditional cantonese-speaking chinese american population more recent arrivals and the larger number of mainland chinese immigrants have largely continued to use mandarin as the exclusive variety of chinese this has led to a linguistic discrimination that has also contributed to social conflicts between the two sides with a growing number of chinese americans including american-born chinese of cantonese background defending the historic chinese american culture against the impacts of increasing mandarin-speaking new arrivals 38 41 canada edit cantonese is the second most common chinese variety spoken among chinese canadians according to the canada 2016 census there were 565,275 canadian residents who reported cantonese as their native language as in the united states the chinese canadian community traces its roots to early immigrants from guangdong during the latter half of the 19th century 42 later chinese immigrants came from hong kong in two waves first in the late 1960s to mid 1970s and again in the 1980s to late 1990s on fears arising from the impending handover to the people s republic of china chinese-speaking immigrants from conflict zones in southeast asia especially vietnam arrived as well beginning in the mid-1970s and were also largely cantonese-speaking unlike the united states recent immigration from mainland china and taiwan to canada has been small and cantonese still remains the predominant chinese variety in the country 43 western europe edit united kingdom edit the overwhelming majority of chinese speakers in the united kingdom use cantonese with about 300,000 british people claiming it as their first language 44 this is largely due to the presence of british hong kongers and the fact that many british chinese also have origins in the former british colonies in southeast asia of singapore and malaysia france edit among the chinese community in france cantonese is spoken by immigrants who fled the former french indochina vietnam cambodia and laos following the conflicts and communist takeovers in the region during the 1970s while a slight majority of ethnic chinese from indochina speak teochew at home knowledge of cantonese is prevalent due to its historic prestige status in the region and is used for commercial and community purposes between the different chinese variety groups as in the united states there is a divide between cantonese-speakers and those speaking other mainland chinese varieties 45 portugal edit cantonese is spoken by ethnic chinese in portugal who originate from macau the most established chinese community in the nation with a presence dating back to the 16th century and portuguese colonialism since the late-20th century however mandarin and wu-speaking migrants from mainland china have outnumbered those from macau although cantonese is still retained among mainstream chinese community associations 46 australia edit cantonese has traditionally been the dominant chinese language of the chinese australian community since the first ethnic chinese settlers arrived in the 1850s it maintained this status until the mid-2000s when a heavy increase in immigration from mandarin-speakers largely from mainland china led to mandarin surpassing cantonese as the dominant chinese dialect spoken cantonese is the third most spoken language in australia in the 2011 census the australian bureau of statistics listed 336,410 and 263,673 speakers of mandarin and cantonese respectively history edit see also yue chinese chinese dictionary from the tang dynasty modern cantonese pronunciation preserves almost all terminal consonants -m -n -ng -p -t -k from middle chinese during the southern song period guangzhou became the cultural center of the region 10 cantonese emerged as the prestige variety of yue chinese when the port city of guangzhou on the pearl river delta became the largest port in china with a trade network stretching as far as arabia 47 cantonese was also used in the popular yuè ōu mùyú and nányīn folksong genres as well as cantonese opera 48 49 additionally a distinct classical literature was developed in cantonese with middle chinese texts sounding more similar to modern cantonese than other present-day chinese varieties including mandarin 50 as guangzhou became china s key commercial center for foreign trade and exchange in the 1700s cantonese became the variety of chinese interacting with most with the western world 47 around this period and continuing into the 1900s the ancestors of most of the population of hong kong and macau arrived from guangzhou and surrounding areas after they were ceded to britain and portugal respectively 51 a popular urban legend claims that after the xinhai revolution of 1912, cantonese almost became the official language of the republic of china but lost by just one vote 52 in mainland china standard chinese based on mandarin has been heavily promoted as the medium of instruction in schools and as the official language especially after the communist takeover in 1949. meanwhile cantonese has remained the official variety of chinese in hong kong and macau both during and after the colonial period 16 cultural role edit gwóngjàu wáh the historically common name for standard cantonese written in traditional left and simplified right chinese characters see also cantonese culture spoken chinese has numerous regional and local varieties many of which are mutually unintelligible most of these are rare outside their native areas though they may be spoken outside of china since a 1909 qing dynasty decree china has promoted mandarin for use in education the media and official communications 53 the proclamation of mandarin as the official national language however was not fully accepted by the cantonese authorities in the early 20th century who argued for the regional uniqueness of their own local language and commercial importance of the region 54 unlike other non-mandarin chinese varieties cantonese persists in a few state television and radio broadcasts today nevertheless there have been recent attempts to minimize the use of cantonese in china the most notable has been the 2010 proposal that guangzhou television increase its broadcast in mandarin at the expense of cantonese programs this however led to protests in guangzhou which eventually dissuaded authorities from going forward with the proposal 55 additionally there are reports of students being punished for speaking other chinese languages at school resulting in a reluctance of younger children to communicate in their native languages including cantonese 56 such actions have further provoked cantonese speakers to cherish their linguistic identity in contrast to migrants who have generally arrived from poorer areas of china and largely speak mandarin or other chinese languages 57 due to the linguistic history of hong kong and macau and the use of cantonese in many established overseas chinese communities diaspora speakers of cantonese is numerous compared to speakers residing in china cantonese is the predominant chinese variety spoken in hong kong and macau in these areas public discourse takes place almost exclusively in cantonese making it the only variety of chinese other than mandarin to be used as an official language in the world because of their dominance in chinese diaspora overseas standard cantonese and its dialect taishanese are among the most common chinese languages that one may encounter in the west increasingly since the 1997 handover cantonese has been used as a symbol of local identity in hong kong largely through the development of democracy in the territory and desinicization practices to emphasise a separate hong kong identity 58 a similar identity issue exists in the united states where conflicts have arisen for the chinese speakers due to a large recent influx of mandarin-speakers while older taiwanese immigrants have learned cantonese to foster integration within the traditional chinese american populations more recent arrivals from the mainland continue to use mandarin exclusively this has contributed to a segregation of communities based on linguistic cleavage in particular some chinese americans including american-born chinese of cantonese background emphasise their non-mainland origins e.g hong kong macau vietnam etc to assert their identity in the face of new waves of immigration 38 41 along with mandarin and hokkien cantonese has its own popular music cantopop which is the predominant genre in hong kong many artists from the mainland and taiwan have learned cantonese to break into the market 59 popular native mandarin-speaking singers including faye wong eric moo and singers from taiwan have been trained in cantonese to add hong kong-ness to their performances 59 cantonese films date to the early days of chinese cinema and the first cantonese talkie white gold dragon 白金龍  was made in 1932 by the tianyi film company 60 despite a ban on cantonese films by the nanjing authority in the 1930s cantonese film production continued in hong kong which was then under british colonial rule 54 61 from the mid-1970s to the 1990s cantonese films made in hong kong were very popular in the chinese speaking world phonology edit main article cantonese phonology see also hong kong cantonese initials and finals edit the de facto standard pronunciation of cantonese is that of canton guangzhou  which is described in the cantonese phonology article hong kong cantonese has some minor variations in phonology but is largely identical to standard guangzhou cantonese in hong kong and macau certain phoneme pairs have caused one sound to merge into another although termed as lazy sound 懶音 and considered substandard to guangzhou pronunciation the phenomenon has been widespread in the territories since the early 20th century the most notable difference between hong kong and guangzhou pronunciation is the substitution of the liquid nasal l for the nasal initial n in many words 62 an example of this is manifested in the word for you 你  pronounced as néih in guangzhou and as léih in hong kong another key feature of hong kong cantonese is the merging of the two syllabic nasals ŋ̩ and m̩  this can be exemplified in the elimination of the contrast of sounds between 吳 ng a surname ng4 ǹgh in guangzhou pronunciation and 唔 not mh4 m̀h in guangzhou pronunciation  in hong kong both words are pronounced as the latter 63 lastly the initials kʷ and kʷʰ can be merged into k and kʰ when followed by ɔː  an example is in the word for country 國  pronounced in standard guangzhou as gwok but as gok with the merge unlike the above two differences this merge is found alongside the standard pronunciation in hong kong rather than being replaced educated speakers often stick to the standard pronunciation but can exemplify the merged pronunciation in casual speech in contrast less educated speakers pronounce the merge more frequently 63 less prevalent but still notable differences found among a number of hong kong speakers include merging of ŋ initial into null initial merging of ŋ and k codas into n and t codas respectively eliminating contrast between these pairs of finals except after e and o aːn - aːŋ  aːt - aːk  ɐn - ɐŋ  ɐt - ɐk  ɔːn - ɔːŋ and ɔːt - ɔːk  merging of the rising tones 陰上 2nd and 陽上 5th  64 cantonese vowels tend to be traced further back to middle chinese back than their mandarin analogues such as m aɪ vs c ɔːi m i vs c ɐi m ɤ vs c ɔː m ɑʊ vs c ou etc for consonants some differences include m ɕ tɕ tɕʰ vs c h k kʰ m ʐ vs c j and a greater syllable coda diversity in cantonese such as syllables ending in -t -p or -k  tones edit generally speaking cantonese is a tonal language with six phonetic tones historically finals that end in a stop consonant were considered as checked tones and treated separately by diachronic convention identifying cantonese with nine tones however phonetically these are now considered a conflation of tone and final consonant and are seldom counted as individual tones in modern linguistics 65 syllable type tone name dark flat 陰平 dark rising 陰上 dark departing 陰去 light flat 陽平 light rising 陽上 light departing 陽去 description high level high falling medium rising

other overseas chinese communities it is usually written with traditional chinese characters however it includes extra characters as well as characters with different meanings from written vernacular chinese due to the presence of words that either do not exist in standard chinese or correspond with spoken cantonese this system of written cantonese is often found in colloquial contexts such as entertainment magazines and social media as well as on advertisements in contrast standard written chinese continues to be used in formal literature professional and government documents and news media nevertheless colloquial characters may be present in formal written communications such as legal testimonies and newspapers when an individual is being quoted rather than paraphrasing spoken cantonese into standard written chinese romanization edit cantonese romanization systems are based on the accent of canton and hong kong and have helped define the concept of standard cantonese the major systems are meyer–wempe the chinese government s guangdong romanization yale and jyutping while they do not differ greatly yale is the one most commonly seen in the west today citation needed the hong kong linguist sidney lau modified the yale system for his popular cantonese-as-a-second-language course and is still widely in use today the cantonese romanization systems of macau are slightly different from hong kong s the spellings are basically influenced by the portuguese language however some words under the macau s romanization systems are same as hong kong s e.g lam 林 chan 陳  words with the alphabet u under hong kong s romanization systems are often replaced by o under macao s romanization systems e.g chau vs chao 周 leung vs leong 梁  both the spellings of hong kong and macao cantonese romanization systems do not look similar to the mainland china s pinyin system generally plain stops are written with voiced consonants p  t  ts  and k as b d z j and g respectively  and aspirated stops with unvoiced ones as in pinyin and icelandic early western effort edit systematic efforts to develop an alphabetic representation of cantonese began with the arrival of protestant missionaries in china early in the nineteenth century romanization was considered both a tool to help new missionaries learn the variety more easily and a quick route for the unlettered to achieve gospel literacy earlier catholic missionaries mostly portuguese had developed romanization schemes for the pronunciation current in the court and capital city of china but made few efforts to romanize other varieties robert morrison the first protestant missionary in china published a vocabulary of the canton dialect 1828 with a rather unsystematic romanized pronunciation elijah coleman bridgman and samuel wells williams in their chinese chrestomathy in the canton dialect 1841 were the progenitors of a long-lived lineage of related romanizations with minor variations embodied in the works of james dyer ball ernst johann eitel and immanuel gottlieb genăhr 1910  bridgman and williams based their system on the phonetic alphabet and diacritics proposed by sir william jones for south asian languages their romanization system embodied the phonological system in a local dialect rhyme dictionary the fenyun cuoyao which was widely used and easily available at the time and is still available today samuel wells willams tonic dictionary of the chinese language in the canton dialect yinghua fenyun cuoyao 1856  is an alphabetic rearrangement translation and annotation of the fenyun to adapt the system to the needs of users at a time when there were only local variants and no standard—although the speech of the western suburbs xiguan of guangzhou was the prestige variety at the time—williams suggested that users learn and follow their teacher s pronunciation of his chart of cantonese syllables it was apparently bridgman s innovation to mark the tones with an open circle upper register tones or an underlined open circle lower register tones at the four corners of the romanized word in analogy with the traditional chinese system of marking the tone of a character with a circle lower left for even upper left for rising upper right for going and lower right for entering tones  john chalmers in his english and cantonese pocket-dictionary 1859 simplified the marking of tones using the acute accent to mark rising tones and the grave to mark going tones and no diacritic for even tones and marking upper register tones by italics or underlining in handwritten work  entering tones could be distinguished by their consonantal ending nicholas belfeld dennys used chalmers romanization in his primer this method of marking tones was adopted in the yale romanization with low register tones marked with an h  a new romanization was developed in the first decade of the twentieth century which eliminated the diacritics on vowels by distinguishing vowel quality by spelling differences e.g a aa o oh  diacritics were used only for marking tones the name of tipson is associated with this new romanization which still embodied the phonology of the fenyun to some extent it is the system used in meyer-wempe and cowles dictionaries and o melia s textbook and many other works in the first half of the twentieth century it was the standard romanization until the yale system supplanted it the distinguished linguist y r chao developed a cantonese adaptation of his gwoyeu romatzyh system the barnett-chao romanization system was first used in chao s cantonese primer published in 1947 by harvard university press the cantonese primer was adapted for mandarin teaching and published by harvard university press in 1948 as mandarin primer  the bc system was also used in textbooks published by the hong kong government cantonese romanization in hong kong edit main article hong kong government cantonese romanisation an influential work on cantonese a chinese syllabary pronounced according to the dialect of canton written by wong shik ling was published in 1941. he derived an ipa-based transcription system the s l wong system used by many chinese dictionaries later published in hong kong although wong also derived a romanization scheme also known as the s l wong system it is not widely used as his transcription scheme this system was preceded by the barnett–chao system used by the hong government language school the romanization advocated by the linguistic society of hong kong lshk is called jyutping the phonetic values of some consonants are closer to the approximate equivalents in ipa than in other systems some effort has been undertaken to promote jyutping but the success of its proliferation within the region has yet to be examined another popular scheme is cantonese pinyin which is the only romanization system accepted by hong kong education and manpower bureau and hong kong examinations and assessment authority books and
