570 kilometres 350 mi west of the cape verde peninsula in west africa the islands cover a combined area of slightly over 4,000 square kilometres 1,500 sq mi  the cape verde archipelago was uninhabited until the 15th century when portuguese explorers discovered and colonized the islands establishing the first european settlement in the tropics ideally located for the atlantic slave trade the islands grew prosperous throughout the 16th and 17th centuries attracting merchants privateers and pirates the end of slavery in the 19th century led to economic decline and emigration cape verde gradually recovered as an important commercial center and stopover for shipping routes incorporated as an overseas department of portugal in 1951, the islands continued to agitate for independence which was peacefully achieved in 1975. since the early 1990s cape verde has been a stable representative democracy and remains one of the most developed and democratic countries in africa lacking natural resources its developing economy is mostly service-oriented with a growing focus on tourism and foreign investment its population of around 512,000 is mostly of mixed european north african berber moorish and sub-saharan african heritage and predominantly roman catholic reflecting the legacy of portuguese rule a sizeable diaspora community exists across the world slightly outnumbering inhabitants on the islands historically the name cape verde has been used in english for the archipelago and since independence in 1975, for the country in 2013, the cape verdean government determined that the portuguese designation cabo verde would henceforth be used for official purposes such as at the united nations even in english contexts cape verde is a member of the african union etymology

discoveries were made by genoa-born antónio de noli who was afterwards appointed governor of cape verde by portuguese king afonso v other navigators mentioned as contributing to discoveries in the cape verde archipelago are diogo gomes who was with antónio de noli and claimed to have been the first to land on and name santiago island  diogo dias diogo afonso and the italian venice-born alvise cadamosto in 1462, portuguese settlers arrived at santiago and founded a settlement they called ribeira grande now called cidade velha to avoid being confused with the town of ribeira grande on the santo antão island  ribeira grande was the first permanent european settlement in the tropics 14 a view of monte cara from mindelo in the 16th century the archipelago prospered from the atlantic slave trade 14 pirates occasionally attacked the portuguese settlements sir francis drake an english corsair privateering under a letter of marque granted by the english crown twice sacked the then capital ribeira grande in 1585 when it was a part of the iberian union 14 after a french attack in 1712, the town declined in importance relative to nearby praia which became the capital in 1770. 14 decline in the slave trade in the 19th century resulted in an economic crisis cape verde s early prosperity slowly vanished however the islands position astride mid-atlantic shipping lanes made cape verde an ideal location for re-supplying ships because of its excellent harbour the city of mindelo located on the island of são vicente became an important commercial centre during the 19th century 14

of the portuguese troops but the organization did not attempt to disrupt portuguese control in cape verde portuguese guinea declared independence in 1973 and was granted de jure independence in 1974.

and is part of the macaronesia ecoregion it lies between latitudes 14° and 18°n and longitudes 22° and 26°w the country is a horseshoe-shaped cluster of ten islands nine inhabited and eight islets 27 that constitute an area of 4033 km2 27 the islands are spatially divided into two groups the barlavento islands windward islands santo antão são vicente santa luzia são nicolau sal boa vista 27 and the sotavento islands leeward maio santiago fogo brava 27 the largest island both in size and population is santiago which hosts the nation s capital praia the principal urban agglomeration in the archipelago 27 three of the cape verde islands sal boa vista and maio are fairly flat sandy and dry the others are generally rockier with more vegetation physical geography and geology edit geologically the islands covering a combined area of slightly over 4,033 square kilometres 1,557 square miles  are principally composed of igneous rocks with volcanic structures and pyroclastic debris comprising the majority of the archipelago s total volume the volcanic and plutonic rocks are distinctly basic the archipelago is a soda-alkaline petrographic province with a petrologic succession similar to that found in other macaronesian islands magnetic anomalies identified in the vicinity of the archipelago indicate that the structures forming the islands date back 125–150 million years the islands themselves date from 8 million in the west to 20 million years in the east  28 the oldest exposed rocks occurred on maio and northern peninsula of santiago and are 128–131 million year old pillow lavas the first stage of volcanism in the islands began in the early miocene and reached its peak at the end of this period when the islands reached their maximum sizes historical volcanism within human settlement has been restricted to the island of fogo the origin of the islands volcanism has been attributed to a hotspot associated with bathymetric swell that formed the cape verde rise 29 the rise is one of the largest protuberances in the world s oceans rising 2.2 kilometres 1.4 miles in a semi-circular region of 1200 km2 associated with a rise of the geoid and elevated surface heat flow 28 most recently erupting in 2014, pico do fogo is the largest active volcano in the region it has a 8 kilometres 5 miles diameter caldera whose rim is 1,600 metres 5,249 feet altitude and an interior cone that rises to 2,829 metres 9,281 feet above sea level the caldera resulted from subsidence following the partial evacuation eruption of the magma chamber along a cylindrical column from within magma chamber at a depth of 8 kilometres 5 miles  extensive salt flats are found on sal and maio 27 on santiago santo antão and são nicolau arid slopes give way in places to sugarcane fields or banana plantations spread along the base of towering mountains 27 ocean cliffs have been formed by catastrophic debris landslides 30 according to the president of nauru cape verde has been

countryside in santiago island a typical landscape of santa catarina santiago island santo antão island landscapes ribeira grande valley in santiago climate edit further information geography of cape verde § climate cape verde s climate is milder than that of the african mainland because the surrounding sea moderates temperatures on the islands and cold atlantic currents produce an arid atmosphere around the archipelago conversely the islands do not receive the upwellings cold streams that affect the west african coast so the air temperature is cooler than in senegal but the sea is warmer because the orographic relief of some islands such as santiago with steep mountains cover it with rich woods and luxuriant vegetation where the humid air condenses and soak the plants rocks soil logs moss etc on the higher islands and somewhat wetter islands exclusively in mountainous areas like santo antão island the climate is suitable for the development of dry monsoon forest and laurel forest as this vegetation 27 average daily high temperatures range from 26 °c 79 °f in february to 31 °c 87.8 °f in september 32 cape verde is part of the sahelian arid belt with nothing like the rainfall
