carnot heat engine - wikipedia carnot heat engine from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search axial cross section of carnot s heat engine in this diagram abcd is a cylindrical vessel cd is a movable piston and a and b are constant–temperature bodies the vessel may be placed in contact with either body or removed from both as it is here  1 a carnot heat engine 2 is an engine that operates on the reversible carnot cycle the basic model for this engine was developed by nicolas léonard sadi carnot in 1824. the carnot engine model was graphically expanded upon by benoît paul émile clapeyron in 1834 and mathematically elaborated upon by rudolf clausius in 1857 from which the concept of entropy emerged every thermodynamic system exists in a particular state a thermodynamic cycle occurs when a system is taken through a series of different states and finally returned to its initial state in the process of going through this cycle the system may perform work on its surroundings thereby acting as a heat engine a heat engine acts by transferring energy from a warm region to a cool region of space and in the process converting some of that energy to mechanical work the cycle may also be reversed the system may be worked upon by an external force and in the process it can transfer thermal energy from a cooler system to a warmer one thereby acting as a refrigerator or heat pump rather than a heat engine carnot s diagram edit in the adjacent diagram from carnot s 1824 work reflections on the motive power of fire 3 there are two bodies a and b kept each at a constant temperature that of a being higher than that of b these two bodies to which we can give or from which we can remove the heat without causing their temperatures to vary exercise the functions of two unlimited reservoirs of caloric we will call the first the furnace and the second the refrigerator.” 4 carnot then explains how we can obtain motive power i.e. “work” by carrying a certain quantity of heat from body a to body b it also acts as a cooler and hence can also act as a refrigerator modern diagram edit carnot engine diagram modern - where an amount of heat qh flows from a high temperature th furnace through the fluid of the working body working substance and the remaining heat qc flows into the cold sink tc thus forcing the working substance to do mechanical work w on the surroundings via cycles of contractions and expansions the previous image shows the original piston-and-cylinder diagram used by carnot in discussing his ideal engines the figure at right shows a block diagram of a generic heat engine such as the carnot engine in the diagram the “working body” system  a term introduced by clausius in 1850, can be any fluid or vapor body through which heat q can be introduced or transmitted to produce work carnot had postulated that the fluid body could be any substance capable of expansion such as vapor of water vapor of alcohol vapor of mercury a permanent gas or air etc although in these early years engines came in a number of configurations typically qh was supplied by a boiler wherein water was boiled over a furnace qc was typically supplied by a stream of cold flowing water in the form of a condenser located on a separate part of the engine the output work w here is the movement of the piston as it is used to turn a crank-arm which was then typically used to turn a pulley so to lift water out of flooded salt mines carnot defined work as “weight lifted through a height” carnot cycle edit figure 1 a carnot cycle illustrated on a pv diagram to illustrate the work done figure 2 a carnot cycle acting as a heat engine illustrated on a temperature-entropy diagram the cycle takes place between a hot reservoir at temperature th and a cold reservoir at temperature tc the vertical axis is temperature the horizontal axis is entropy main article carnot cycle the carnot cycle when acting as a heat engine consists of the following steps reversible isothermal expansion of the gas at the hot temperature th isothermal heat addition or absorption  during this step 1 to 2 on figure 1, a to b in figure 2 the gas is allowed to expand and it does work on the surroundings the temperature of the gas does not change during the process and thus the expansion is isothermic the gas expansion is propelled by absorption of heat energy q1 and of entropy δ s h q h t h \displaystyle \delta s \text h q \text h t \text h from the high temperature reservoir isentropic reversible adiabatic expansion of the gas isentropic work output  for this step 2 to 3 on figure 1, b to c in figure 2 the piston and cylinder are assumed to be thermally insulated thus they neither gain nor lose heat the gas continues to expand doing work on the surroundings and losing an equivalent amount of internal energy the gas expansion causes it to cool to the cold temperature tc the entropy remains unchanged reversible isothermal compression of the gas at the cold temperature tc isothermal heat rejection 3 to 4 on figure 1, c to d on figure 2 now the gas is exposed to the cold temperature reservoir while the surroundings do work on the gas by compressing it such as through the return compression of a piston  while causing an amount of heat energy q2 and of entropy δ s c q c t c \displaystyle \delta s \text c q \text c t \text c to flow out of the gas to the low temperature reservoir this is the same amount of entropy absorbed in step 1. this work is less than the work performed on the surroundings in step 1 because it occurs at a lower pressure given the removal of heat to the cold reservoir as the compression occurs i.e the resistance to compression is lower under step 3 than the force of expansion under step 1  isentropic compression of the gas isentropic work input  4 to 1 on figure 1, d to a on figure 2 once again the piston and cylinder are assumed to be thermally insulated and the cold temperature reservoir is removed during this step the surroundings continue to do work to further compress the gas and both the temperature and pressure rise now that the heat sink has been removed this additional work increases the internal energy of the gas compressing it and causing the temperature to rise to th the entropy remains unchanged at this point the gas is in the same state as at the start of step 1. citation needed carnot s theorem edit main article carnot s theorem thermodynamics real ideal engines left compared to the carnot cycle right  the entropy of a real material changes with temperature this change is indicated by the curve on a t-s diagram for this figure the curve indicates a vapor-liquid equilibrium see rankine cycle  irreversible systems and losses of heat for example due to friction prevent the ideal from taking place at every step carnot s theorem is a formal statement of this fact no engine operating between two heat reservoirs can be more efficient than a carnot engine operating between the same reservoirs η i 2 q h 1 − t c t h 1 \displaystyle \eta \text i \frac 2 q \text h 1- \frac t \text c t \text h \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad 1 explanation this maximum efficiency η i \displaystyle \eta \text i is defined as above w \displaystyle w is the work done by the system energy exiting the system as work  q h \displaystyle q \text h is the heat put into the system heat energy entering the system  t c \displaystyle t \text c is the absolute temperature of the cold reservoir and t h \displaystyle t \text h is the absolute temperature of the hot reservoir a corollary to carnot s theorem states that all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient it is easily shown that the efficiency η \displaystyle \eta is maximum when the entire cyclic process is a reversible process this means the total entropy of the net system the entropies of the hot furnace the working fluid of the heat engine and the cold sink remains constant when the working fluid completes one cycle and returns to its original state in the general case the total entropy of this combined system would increase in a general irreversible process  since the working fluid comes back to the same state after one cycle and entropy of the system is a state function the change in entropy of the working fluid system is 0. thus it implies that the total entropy change of the furnace and sink is zero for the process to be reversible and the efficiency of the engine to be maximum this derivation is carried out in the next section the coefficient of performance cop of the heat engine is the reciprocal of its efficiency efficiency of real heat engines edit for a real heat engine the total thermodynamic process is generally irreversible the working fluid is brought back to its initial state after one cycle and thus the change of entropy of the fluid system is 0, but the sum of the entropy changes in the hot and cold reservoir in this one cyclical process is greater than 0. the internal energy of the fluid is also a state variable so its total change in one cycle is 0. so the total work done by the system w \displaystyle w  is equal to the heat put into the system q h \displaystyle q \text h minus the heat taken out q c \displaystyle q \text c  w q h − q c 2 \displaystyle w q \text h -q \text c \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad 2 for real engines sections 1 and 3 of the carnot cycle in which heat is absorbed by the working fluid from the hot reservoir and released by it to the cold reservoir respectively no longer remain ideally reversible and there is a temperature differential between the temperature of the reservoir and the temperature of the fluid while heat exchange takes place during heat transfer from the hot reservoir at t h \displaystyle t \text h to the fluid the fluid would have a slightly lower temperature than t h \displaystyle t \text h  and the process for the fluid may not necessarily remain isothermal let δ s h \displaystyle \delta s \text h be the total entropy change of the fluid in the process of intake of heat δ s h ∫ q in d q h t 3 \displaystyle \delta s \text h \int q \text in \frac \text d q \text h t \quad \quad \quad \quad 3 where the temperature of the fluid t \displaystyle t is always slightly lesser than t h \displaystyle t \text h  in this process so one would get q h t h ∫ d q h t h ≤ δ s h 4 \displaystyle \frac q \text h t \text h \frac \int \text d q \text h t \text h \leq \delta s \text h \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad 4 similarly at the time of heat injection from the fluid to the cold reservoir one would have for the magnitude of total entropy change δ s c \displaystyle \delta s \text c of the fluid in the process of expelling heat δ s c ∫ q out d q c t ≤ ∫ d q c t c q c t c 5 \displaystyle \delta s \text c \int q \text out \frac \text d q \text c t \leq \frac \int \text d q \text c t \text c \frac q \text c t \text c \quad \quad \quad \quad 5  where during this process of transfer of heat to the cold reservoir the temperature of the fluid t \displaystyle t is always slightly greater than t c \displaystyle t \text c  we have only considered the magnitude of the entropy change here since the total change of entropy of the fluid system for the cyclic process is 0, we must have δ s h δ s c 6 \displaystyle \delta s \text h \delta s \text c \quad \quad \quad \quad 6 the previous three equations combine to give q c t c ≥ q h t h 7 \displaystyle \frac q \text c t \text c \geq \frac q \text h t \text h \quad \quad \quad \quad 7 equations 2 and 7 combine to give w q h ≤ 1 − t c t h 8 \displaystyle \frac w q \text h \leq 1- \frac t \text c t \text h \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad 8 hence η ≤ η i 9 \displaystyle \eta \leq \eta \text i \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad 9 where η w q h \displaystyle \eta \frac w q \text h is the efficiency of the real engine and η i \displaystyle \eta \text i is the efficiency of the carnot engine working between the same two reservoirs at the temperatures t h \displaystyle t \text h and t c \displaystyle t \text c  for the carnot engine the entire process is reversible  and equation 7 is an equality hence the efficiency of the real engine is always less than the ideal carnot engine equation 7 signifies that the total entropy of the total system the two reservoirs fluid increases for the real engine because the entropy gain of the cold reservoir as q c \displaystyle q \text c flows into it at the fixed temperature t c \displaystyle t \text c  is greater than the entropy loss of the hot reservoir as q h \displaystyle q \text h leaves it at its fixed temperature t h \displaystyle t \text h  the inequality in equation 7 is essentially the statement of the clausius theorem according to the second theorem the efficiency of the carnot engine is independent of the nature of the working substance  notes edit figure 1 in carnot 1824, p 17
