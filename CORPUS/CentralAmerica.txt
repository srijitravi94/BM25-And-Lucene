guatemala through to central panama due to the presence of several active geologic faults and the central america volcanic arc there is a great deal of seismic activity in the region volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur frequently these natural disasters have resulted in the loss of many lives and much property in the pre-columbian era central america was inhabited by the indigenous peoples of mesoamerica to the north and west and the isthmo-colombian peoples to the south and east soon after christopher columbus s voyages to the americas the spanish began to colonize the americas from 1609 until 1821, most of the territory within central america—except for the lands that would become belize and panama—was governed by the viceroyalty of new spain from mexico city as the captaincy general of guatemala after new spain achieved independence from spain in 1821, some of its provinces were annexed to the first mexican empire but soon seceded from mexico to form the federal republic of central america which lasted from 1823 to 1838. the seven states finally became independent autonomous states beginning with nicaragua honduras costa rica and guatemala 1838 followed by el salvador 1841 then panama 1903 and finally belize 1981  even today though people in central america sometimes still refer to their nations as though they are provinces of a central american state e.g

and are considered by some 11 culturally different and grouped in the isthmo-colombian area following christopher columbus s voyages to the americas the spanish sent many expeditions to the region and they began their conquest of maya territory in 1523. soon after the conquest of the aztec empire spanish conquistador pedro de alvarado commenced the conquest of northern central america for the spanish empire beginning with his arrival in soconusco in 1523, alvarado s forces systematically conquered and subjugated most of the major maya kingdoms including the k iche  tz utujil pipil and the kaqchikel by 1528, the conquest of guatemala was nearly complete with only the petén basin remaining outside the spanish sphere of influence the last independent maya kingdoms – the kowoj and the itza

area included the current territories of costa rica el salvador guatemala honduras nicaragua and the mexican state of chiapas but excluded the lands that would become belize and panama the president of the audiencia which had its seat in antigua guatemala was the governor of the entire area in 1609 the area became a captaincy general and the governor was also granted the title of captain general the captaincy general of guatemala encompassed most of central america with the exception of present-day belize and panama the captaincy general of guatemala lasted for more than two centuries but began to fray after a rebellion in 1811 which began in the intendancy of san salvador the captaincy general formally ended on 15 september 1821, with the signing of the act of independence of central america mexican independence was achieved at virtually the same time with the signing of the treaty of córdoba and the declaration of independence of the mexican empire and the entire region was finally independent from spanish authority by 28 september 1821. from its independence from spain in 1821 until 1823, the former captaincy general remained intact as part of the short-lived first mexican empire when the emperor of mexico abdicated on 19 march 1823, central america again became independent on 1 july 1823, the congress of central america peacefully seceded from mexico and

peru along with all other spanish possessions in south america panama remained as part of the viceroyalty of peru until 1739, when it was transferred to the viceroyalty of new granada the capital of which was located at santa fé de bogotá panama remained as part of the viceroyalty of new granada until the disestablishment of that viceroyalty in 1819. a series of military and political struggles took place from that time until 1822, the result of which produced the republic of gran colombia after the dissolution of gran colombia in 1830, panama became part of a successor state the republic of new granada from 1855 until 1886, panama existed as panama state first within the republic of new granada then within the granadine confederation and finally within the united states of colombia the

wildlife fund 31 these forests are of the moist deciduous and the semi-evergreen seasonal subtype of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests and receive high overall rainfall with a warm summer wet season and a cooler winter dry season central american montane forests consist of forest patches located at altitudes ranging from 1,800–4,000 metres 5,900–13,100 ft  on the summits and slopes of the highest mountains in central america ranging from southern mexico through guatemala el salvador and honduras to northern nicaragua the entire ecoregion covers an area of 13,200 square

procnias tricarunculata  bare-necked umbrellabird cephalopterus glabricollis  and black guan chamaepetes unicolor  many of the amphibians are endemic and depend on the existence of forest the golden toad that once inhabited a small region in the monteverde reserve which is part of the talamancan montane forests has not been seen alive since 1989 and is listed as extinct by iucn the exact causes for its extincition are unknown global warming may have played a role because the development of fog that is typical for this area may have been compromised seven small mammals are endemic to the

list of earthquakes in el salvador list of earthquakes in guatemala and list of earthquakes in nicaragua central america is geologically very active with volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occurring frequently and tsunamis occurring occasionally many thousands of people have died as a result of these natural disasters most of central america rests atop the caribbean plate this tectonic plate converges with the cocos nazca and north american plates to form the middle america trench a major subduction zone the middle america trench is situated some 60–160 kilometers 37–99 mi off the pacific coast of central america and runs roughly parallel to it many large earthquakes have occurred as a result of seismic activity at the middle america trench 32 for example subduction of the cocos plate beneath the north american plate at the middle america trench is believed to have caused the 1985 mexico city earthquake that killed as many as 40,000 people seismic activity at the middle america trench is also responsible for earthquakes in 1902, 1942, 1956, 1982, 1992, 2001, 2007, 2012, 2014, and many other earthquakes throughout central america the middle america trench is not the only source of seismic activity in central america the motagua fault is an onshore continuation of the cayman trough which forms part of the tectonic boundary between the north american plate and the caribbean plate this transform fault cuts right across guatemala and then continues offshore until it merges with the middle america trench along the pacific coast of mexico near acapulco seismic activity at the motagua fault has been responsible for earthquakes in 1717, 1773, 1902, 1976, 1980, and 2009. another onshore continuation of the cayman trough is the chixoy-polochic fault which runs parallel to and roughly 80 kilometers 50 mi to the north of the motagua fault though less active than the motagua fault seismic activity at the chixoy-polochic fault is still thought to be capable of producing very large earthquakes such as the 1816 earthquake of guatemala 33 managua the capital of nicaragua was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972. volcanic eruptions are also common in central america in 1968 the arenal volcano in costa rica erupted killing 87 people as the 3 villages of tabacon pueblo nuevo and san luis were buried under pyroclastic flows and debris fertile soils
