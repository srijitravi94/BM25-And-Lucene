cloud seeding - wikipedia cloud seeding from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article is about weather modification it is not to be confused with chemtrail conspiracy theory cloud seeding can be done by ground generators plane or rocket this image explaining cloud seeding shows the chemical either silver iodide or dry ice being dumped onto the cloud which then becomes a rain shower the process shown in the upper-right is what is happening in the cloud and the process of condensation to the introduced chemicals 1 cloud seeding is a form of weather modification a way of changing the amount or type of precipitation that falls from clouds by dispersing substances into the air that serve as cloud condensation or ice nuclei which alter the microphysical processes within the cloud the usual intent is to increase precipitation rain or snow  but hail and fog suppression are also widely practiced in airports cloud seeding also occurs due to ice nucleators in nature most of which are bacterial in origin 2 methodology edit the most common chemicals used for cloud seeding include silver iodide potassium iodide and dry ice solid carbon dioxide  liquid propane which expands into a gas has also been used this can produce ice crystals at higher temperatures than silver iodide after promising research the use of hygroscopic materials such as table salt is becoming more popular 3 when cloud seeding increased snowfall takes place when temperatures within the clouds are between 19 and −4 °f −7 and −20 °c  4 introduction of a substance such as silver iodide which has a crystalline structure similar to that of ice will induce freezing nucleation in mid-altitude clouds the usual seeding strategy has been based on the fact that the equilibrium vapor pressure is lower over ice than over water the formation of ice particles in supercooled clouds allows those particles to grow at the expense of liquid droplets if sufficient growth takes place the particles become heavy enough to fall as precipitation from clouds that otherwise would produce no precipitation this process is known as static seeding seeding of warm-season or tropical convective clouds seeks to exploit the latent heat released by freezing this strategy of dynamic seeding assumes that the additional latent heat adds buoyancy strengthens updrafts ensures more low-level convergence and ultimately causes rapid growth of properly selected clouds cloud seeding chemicals may be dispersed by aircraft or by dispersion devices located on the ground generators or canisters fired from anti-aircraft guns or rockets  for release by aircraft silver iodide flares are ignited and dispersed as an aircraft flies through the inflow of a cloud when released by devices on the ground the fine particles are carried downwind and upward by air currents after release an electronic mechanism was tested in 2010, when infrared laser pulses were directed to the air above berlin by researchers from the university of geneva 5 the experimenters posited that the pulses would encourage atmospheric sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide to form particles that would then act as seeds 5 effectiveness edit cloud seeding has never been statistically proven to work an ecologist at stanford university says i think you can squeeze out a little more snow or rain in some places under some conditions but that s quite different from a program claiming to reliably increase precipitation 6 claims are made that new technology and research has produced reliable results that make cloud seeding a dependable and affordable water supply practice for many regions 7 but while practiced widely around the world the effectiveness of cloud seeding is still a matter of academic debate 8 in 2003 the us national research council nrc released a report stating ..science is unable to say with assurance which if any seeding techniques produce positive effects in the 55 years following the first cloud-seeding demonstrations substantial progress has been made in understanding the natural processes that account for our daily weather yet scientifically acceptable proof for significant seeding effects has not been achieved,.. 9 13 referring to 1903, 1915, 1919, 1944, and 1947 weather modification experiments the australian federation of meteorology discounted rain making  by the 1950s the csiro division of radiophysics switched to investigating the physics of clouds and had hoped by 1957 to better understand these processes by the 1960s the dreams of weather making had faded only to be re-ignited post-corporatisation of the snowy mountains scheme in order to achieve above target water this would provide enhanced energy generation and profits to the public agencies that are the principal owners recently in 2017, this process had been used by the uae for it had been forecasted that it won t rain for the whole year in the uae cloud seeding has been shown to be effective in altering cloud structure and size and in converting supercooled liquid water to ice particles the amount of precipitation due to seeding is difficult to quantify there is statistical evidence for seasonal precipitation increases of about 10 percent with winter seeding 10 clouds were seeded during the 2008 summer olympics in beijing using rockets to coax rain showers out of clouds before they reached the olympic city so that there would be no rain during the opening and closing ceremonies 11 although others dispute their claims of success 12 a 2010 tel aviv university study claimed that the common practice of cloud seeding to improve rainfall with materials such as silver iodide and frozen carbon dioxide seems to have little if any impact on the amount of precipitation 13 a 2011 study suggested that airplanes may produce ice particles by freezing cloud droplets that cool as they flow around the tips of propellers over wings or over jet aircraft and thereby unintentionally seed clouds this could have potentially serious consequences for particular hail stone formation 14 impact on environment and health edit with an nfpa 704 health hazard rating of 2, silver iodide can cause temporary incapacitation or possible residual injury to humans and mammals with intense or chronic exposure however there have been several detailed ecological studies that showed negligible environmental and health impacts 15 16 17 the toxicity of silver and silver compounds from silver iodide was shown to be of low order in some studies these findings likely result from the minute amounts of silver generated by cloud seeding which are about one percent of industry emissions into the atmosphere in many parts of the world or individual exposure from tooth fillings 18 accumulations in the soil vegetation and surface runoff have not been large enough to measure above natural background 19 a 1995 environmental assessment in the sierra nevada of california 20 and a 2004 independent panel of experts in australia confirmed these earlier findings 21 in 1978, an estimated 2,740 tonnes of silver were released into the us environment this led the us health services and epa to conduct studies regarding the potential for environmental and human health hazards related to silver these agencies and other state agencies applied the clean water act of 1977 and 1987 to establish regulations on this type of pollution 22 cloud seeding over kosciuszko national park—a biosphere reserve—is problematic in that several rapid changes of environmental legislation were made to enable the trial environmentalists are concerned about the uptake of elemental silver in a highly sensitive environment affecting the pygmy possum among other species as well as recent high level algal blooms in once pristine glacial lakes research 50 years ago and analysis by the former snowy mountains authority led to the cessation of the cloud seeding program in the 1950s with non-definitive results formerly cloud seeding was rejected in australia on environmental grounds because of concerns about the protected species the pygmy possum 23 since silver iodide and not elemental silver is the cloud seeding material the claims of negative environmental impact are disputed by peer-reviewed research as summarized by the international weather modification association 24 history of cloud seeding edit cessna 210 with cloud seeding equipment vincent schaefer 1906–1993 discovered the principle of cloud seeding in july 1946 through a series of serendipitous events following ideas generated between him and nobel laureate irving langmuir while climbing mt washington in new hampshire schaefer langmuir s research associate created a way of experimenting with super-cooled clouds using a deep freeze unit of potential agents to stimulate ice crystal growth i.e. table salt talcum powder soils dust and various chemical agents with minor effect then one hot and humid july 14, 1946, he wanted to try a few experiments at general electric s schenectady research lab he was dismayed to find that the deep freezer was not cold enough to produce a cloud using breath air he decided to move the process along by adding a chunk of dry ice just to lower the temperature of his experimental chamber to his astonishment as soon as he breathed into the deep freezer he noted a bluish haze followed by an eye-popping display of millions of microscopic ice crystals reflecting the strong light rays from the lamp illuminating a cross-section of the chamber he instantly realized that he had discovered a way to change super-cooled water into ice crystals the experiment was easily replicated and he explored the temperature gradient to establish the −40 °c limit for liquid water 25 within the month schaefer s colleague the noted atmospheric scientist dr bernard vonnegut brother of novelist kurt vonnegut was credited with discovering another method for seeding super-cooled cloud water vonnegut accomplished his discovery at the desk looking up information in a basic chemistry text and then tinkering with silver and iodide chemicals to produce silver iodide together with professor henry chessin suny albany a crystallographer he co-authored a publication in science 26 and received a patent in 1975. 27 both methods were adopted for use in cloud seeding during 1946 while working for the general electric corporation in the state of new york schaefer s method altered a cloud s heat budget vonnegut s altered formative crystal structure an ingenious property related to a good match in lattice constant between the two types of crystal the crystallography of ice later played a role in kurt vonnegut s novel cat s cradle  the first attempt to modify natural clouds in the field through cloud seeding began during a flight that began in upstate new york on 13 november 1946. schaefer was able to cause snow to fall near mount greylock in western massachusetts after he dumped six pounds of dry ice into the target cloud from a plane after a 60-mile easterly chase from the schenectady county airport 28 dry ice and silver iodide agents are effective in changing the physical chemistry of super-cooled clouds thus useful in augmentation of winter snowfall over mountains and under certain conditions in lightning and hail suppression while not a new technique hygroscopic seeding for enhancement of rainfall in warm clouds is enjoying a revival based on some positive indications from research in south africa mexico and elsewhere the hygroscopic material most commonly used is table salt it is postulated that hygroscopic seeding causes the droplet size spectrum in clouds to become more maritime bigger drops and less continental stimulating rainfall through coalescence from march 1967 until july 1972, the us military s operation popeye cloud-seeded silver iodide to extend the monsoon season over north vietnam specifically the ho chi minh trail the operation resulted in the targeted areas seeing an extension of the monsoon period an average of 30 to 45 days 29 the 54th weather reconnaissance squadron carried out the operation to make mud not war  30 one private organization that offered during the 1970s to conduct weather modification cloud seeding from the ground using silver iodide flares was irving p krick and associates of palm springs california they were contracted by oklahoma state university in 1972 to conduct a seeding project to increase warm cloud rainfall in the lake carl blackwell watershed that lake was at that time 1972–73  the primary water supply for stillwater oklahoma and was dangerously low the project did not operate for a long enough time to show statistically any change from natural variations citation needed an attempt by the united states military to modify hurricanes in the atlantic basin using cloud seeding in the 1960s was called project stormfury only a few hurricanes were tested with cloud seeding because of the strict rules set by the scientists of the project it was unclear whether the project was successful hurricanes appeared to change slightly in structure but only temporarily the fear that cloud seeding could potentially change the course or power of hurricanes and negatively affect people in the storm s path stopped the project citation needed two federal agencies have supported various weather modification research projects which began in the early-1960s the united states bureau of reclamation reclamation department of the interior and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa department of commerce  reclamation sponsored several cloud seeding research projects under the umbrella of project skywater from 1964 to 1988, and noaa conducted the atmospheric modification program from 1979 to 1993. the sponsored projects were carried out in several states and two countries thailand and morocco  studying both winter and summer cloud seeding from 1962 to 1988 reclamation developed cloud seeding applied research to augment water supplies in the western us the research focused on winter orographic seeding to enhance snowfall in the rocky mountains and sierra nevada and precipitation in coast ranges of southern california in california reclamation partnered with the california department of water resources cdwr to sponsor the serra cooperative pilot project scpp  based in auburn ca to conduct seeding experiments in the central sierra the university of nevada and desert research institute provided cloud physics physical chemistry and other field support the high plains cooperative pilot project hiplex  focused on convective cloud seeding to increase rainfall during the growing season in montana kansas and texas from 1974 to 1979. in 1979, the world meteorological organization and other member-states led by the government of spain conducted a precipitation enhancement project pep in spain 31 with inconclusive results due probably to location selection issues 32 reclamation sponsored research at several universities including colorado state university universities of wyoming washington ucla utah chicago nyu montana colorado and research teams at stanford meteorology research inc. and penn state university and south dakota school of mines and technology north dakota texas a m texas tech and oklahoma cooperative efforts with state water resources agencies in california colorado montana kansas oklahoma texas and arizona assured that the applied research met state water management needs the high plains cooperative pilot project also engaged in partnerships with nasa environment canada and the national center for atmospheric research ncar  more recently in cooperation with six western states reclamation sponsored a small cooperative research program called the weather damage modification program 33 from 2002–2006 in the united states funding for research has declined in the last two decades however the bureau of reclamation sponsored a six-state research program from 2002–2006 called the weather damage modification program  34 a 2003 study by the united states national academy of sciences urges a national research program to clear up remaining questions about weather modification s efficacy and practice 35 in australia the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro conducted major trials between 1947 and the early-1960s 1947 – 1952 csiro scientists dropped dry ice into the tops of clouds the method worked reliably with clouds that were very cold producing rain that would not have otherwise fallen 1953 – 1956 csiro carried out similar trials in south australia queensland and other states experiments used both ground-based and airborne silver iodide generators late-1950s and early-1960s cloud seeding in the snowy mountains on the cape york peninsula in queensland in the new england district of new south wales and in the warragamba catchment area west of sydney only the trial conducted in the snowy mountains produced statistically significant rainfall increases over the entire experiment citation needed an austrian study 36 to use silver iodide seeding for hail prevention ran during 1981–2000 and the technique is still actively deployed there 37 asia edit china edit the largest cloud seeding system is in the people s republic of china they believe that it increases the amount of rain over several increasingly arid regions including its capital city beijing by firing silver iodide rockets into the sky where rain is desired there is even political strife caused by neighboring regions that accuse each other of stealing rain using cloud seeding about 24 countries currently practice weather modification operationally citation needed china used cloud seeding in beijing just before the 2008 olympic games in order to have a dry olympic season 38 in february 2009, china also blasted iodide sticks over beijing to artificially induce snowfall after four months of drought and blasted iodide sticks over other areas of northern china to increase snowfall the snowfall in beijing lasted for approximately three days and led to the closure of 12 main roads around beijing 39 at the end of october 2009 beijing claimed it had its earliest snowfall since 1987 due to cloud seeding 40 india edit in india cloud seeding operations were conducted during the years 1983, 1984–87,1993-94 by tamil nadu govt due to severe drought 41 in the years 2003 and 2004 karnataka government initiated cloud seeding cloud seeding operations were also conducted in the same year through us-based weather modification inc in the state of maharashtra 42 in 2008, there were plans for 12 districts of state of andhra pradesh 43 indonesia edit in jakarta cloud seeding was used to minimize flood risk in anticipation of heavy floods in 2013, according to the agency for the assessment and application of technology 44 israel edit israel has been enhancing rain in convective clouds since the 1950s the practice involves emitting silver iodide from airplanes and ground stations the seeding takes place only in the northern parts of israel 45 kuwait edit to counter drought and a growing population in a desert region kuwait is embarking on its own cloud seeding program with the local environment public authority conducting a study to gauge its viability locally 46 southeast asia edit in southeast asia open burning haze pollutes the regional environment cloud-seeding has been used to improve the air quality by encouraging rainfall on 20 june 2013, indonesia said it will begin cloud-seeding operations following reports from singapore and malaysia that smog caused by forest and bush fires in sumatra have disrupted daily activities in the neighboring countries 47 on 25 june 2013, hailstones were reported to have fallen over some parts of singapore 48 despite nea denials some believe that the hailstones are the result of cloud seeding in indonesia in 2015 cloud seeding was done daily in malaysia since the haze began in early-august 49 thailand started a rain-making project in the late-1950s known today as the royal rainmaking project its first efforts scattered sea salt in the air to catch the humidity and dry ice to condense the humidity to form clouds 50 the project took about ten years of experiments and refinement the first field operations began in 1969 above khao yai national park since then the thai government claims that rainmaking has been successfully applied throughout thailand and neighboring countries 51 on 12 october 2005 the european patent office granted to king bhumibol adulyadej the patent ep 1 491 088 weather modification by royal rainmaking technology 52 united arab emirates edit the uae is one of the first countries in the persian gulf region to use cloud seeding technology it adopted the latest technologies available on a global level using sophisticated weather radar to monitor the atmosphere of the country around the clock 53 in the united arab emirates cloud seeding is being conducted by the weather authorities to create artificial rain 54 the project which began in july 2010 and cost us 11 million has been successful in creating rain storms in the dubai and abu dhabi deserts 55 the united arab emirates has an arid climate with less than 100mm per year of rainfall a high evaporation rate of surface water and a low groundwater recharge rate although rainfall in the uae has been fluctuating over the last few decades in winter season most of that occurs in the december to march period during the summer months the prevailing indian monsoon drought effect leads to a build-up of clouds especially along the mountainous terrain in the eastern uae 56 the uae cloud-seeding program was initiated in the late 1990s by early 2001 the program was being conducted in cooperation with the national center for atmospheric research ncar in colorado usa the witwatersrand university in south africa and the us space agency nasa 57 in 2005, the uae launched the uae prize for excellence in advancing the science and practice of weather modification in collaboration with the world meteorological organization 58 wmo  this prize was thereafter reshaped into the international research program for rain enhancement science it subsequently became the uae research program for rain enhancement science in january 2015. the program for rain enhancement science is an initiative of the united arab emirates ministry of presidential affairs it is overseen by the uae national center of meteorology seismology 59 ncms based in abu dhabi 60 among its key goals are advancing the science technology and implementation of rain enhancement and encouraging additional investments in research funding and research partnerships to advance the field increasing rainfall and ensuring water security globally the uae now has more 75 networked automatic weather stations distributed across the uae 7 air quality stations a sophisticated doppler weather radar network of five stationary and one mobile radars and six beechcraft king air c90 aircraft for cloud seeding operations natural salts such as potassium chloride and sodium chloride are used in these operations 61 at present the uae mostly seed with salt particles in the eastern mountains on the border to oman to raise levels in aquifers and reservoirs 62 forecasters and scientists have estimated that cloud seeding operations can enhance rainfall by as much as 30 to 35 per cent in a clear atmosphere and by up to 10 to 15 per cent in a turbid atmosphere 63 a total of 187 missions were sent to seed clouds in the uae in 2015, with each aircraft taking about three hours to target five to six clouds at a cost of 3,000 per operation 64 north america edit united states edit in the united states cloud seeding is used to increase precipitation in areas experiencing drought to reduce the size of hailstones that form in thunderstorms and to reduce the amount of fog in and around airports in the summer of 1948, the usually humid city of alexandria louisiana under mayor carl b close seeded a cloud with dry ice at the municipal airport during a drought quickly 0.85 inches of rainfall occurred 65 cloud seeding is occasionally used by major ski resorts to induce snowfall eleven western states and one canadian province alberta have ongoing weather modification operational programs 3  in january 2006, an 8.8 million cloud seeding project began in wyoming to examine the effects of cloud seeding on snowfall over wyoming s medicine bow sierra madre and wind river mountain ranges 66 a number of commercial companies offer weather modification services centered on cloud seeding citation needed the us signed an international treaty in 1978 banning the use of weather modification for hostile purposes 67 canada edit during the sixties irving p krick associates operated a successful cloud seeding operation in the area around calgary alberta this utilized both aircraft and ground-based generators that pumped silver iodide into the atmosphere in an

french program was supported by insurance data that of the spanish program in studies conducted by the spanish agricultural ministry 69 russia edit the soviet union created a specifically designed version of the antonov an-30 aerial survey aircraft the an-30m sky cleaner with eight containers of solid carbon dioxide in the cargo area plus external pods containing meteorological cartridges that could be fired into clouds 70 soviet military pilots seeded clouds over the belorussian ssr after the chernobyl disaster to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward moscow 71 currently an-26 is also used for cloud seeding 72 at the july 2006 g8 summit in st petersburg president putin commented that air force jets had been deployed to seed incoming clouds so they rained over finland rain drenched the summit anyway 73 in moscow the russian airforce tried seeding clouds with bags of cement on june 17, 2008. one of the bags did not pulverize and went through the roof of a house 74 in october 2009, the mayor of moscow promised a winter without snow for the city after revealing efforts by the russian air force to seed the clouds upwind from moscow throughout the winter 75 germany

have been successful 78 seeding over the hydro-electricity commission catchment area on the central plateau achieved rainfall increases as high as 30 percent in autumn the tasmanian experiments were so successful that the commission has regularly undertaken seeding ever since in mountainous parts of the state in 2004, snowy hydro limited began a trial of cloud seeding to assess the feasibility of increasing snow precipitation in the snowy mountains in australia 79 the test period originally scheduled to end in 2009, was later extended to 2014. 79 the new south wales nsw natural resources commission responsible for supervising the cloud seeding operations believes that the trial may have difficulty establishing statistically whether cloud seeding operations are increasing snowfall this project was discussed at a summit in narrabri nsw on 1 december 2006. the summit met with the intention of outlining a proposal for a 5-year trial focusing on northern nsw the various implications of such a widespread trial were discussed drawing on the combined knowledge of several worldwide experts including representatives from the tasmanian hydro cloud seeding project however does not make reference to former cloud seeding experiments by the then-snowy mountains authority which rejected weather modification the trial required changes to nsw environmental legislation in order to facilitate placement of the cloud seeding apparatus the modern experiment is not supported for the australian alps in december 2006, the queensland government of australia announced a 7.6 million in
