raise funds for the foundation of a new college in 1751, the assembly appointed a commission of ten new york residents seven of whom were members of the church of england to direct the funds accrued by the state lottery towards the foundation of a college 35 classes were initially held in july 1754 and were presided over by the college s first president dr samuel johnson 36 dr johnson was the

and in an effort to demonstrate its support for the new republic the legislature stipulated that the college within the city of new york heretofore called king s college be forever hereafter called and known by the name of columbia college  43 a reference to columbia an alternative name for america the regents finally became aware of the college s defective constitution in february 1787 and

street and madison avenue where it remained for the next forty years during the last half of the 19th century under the leadership of president f.a.p barnard the institution rapidly assumed the shape of a modern university 47 by this time the college s investments in new york real estate became a primary source of steady income for the school mainly owing to the city s expanding population 48

range of professional and inter-disciplinary fields 58 alma mater in the aftermath of world war ii the discipline of international relations became a major scholarly focus of the university and in
