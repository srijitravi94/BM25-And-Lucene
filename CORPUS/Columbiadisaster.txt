casualties rick d husband william c mccool michael p anderson kalpana chawla david m brown laurel clark ilan ramon inquiries columbia accident investigation board on february 1, 2003, the space shuttle columbia disintegrated upon reentering earth s atmosphere killing all seven crew members the disaster was the second fatal accident in the space shuttle program after space shuttle challenger which broke apart and killed the seven-member crew 73 seconds after liftoff in 1986. during the launch of sts-107 columbia s 28th mission a piece of foam insulation broke off from the space shuttle external tank and struck the left wing of the orbiter a few previous shuttle launches had seen damage ranging from minor to major from foam shedding 1 2 but some engineers suspected that the damage to columbia was more serious nasa managers limited the investigation reasoning that the crew could not have fixed the problem if it had been confirmed 3 when columbia re-entered the atmosphere of earth the damage allowed hot atmospheric gases to penetrate and destroy the internal wing structure which caused the spacecraft to become unstable and break apart 4 after the disaster space shuttle flight operations were suspended for more than two years as they had been after the challenger disaster construction of the international space station iss was put on hold the station relied entirely on the russian roscosmos state corporation for resupply for 29 months until shuttle flights resumed with sts-114 and 41 months for crew rotation until sts-121 several technical and organizational changes were made including adding a thorough on-orbit inspection to determine how well the shuttle s thermal protection system had endured the ascent and keeping a designated rescue mission ready in case irreparable damage was found except for one final mission to repair the hubble space telescope subsequent shuttle missions were flown only to the iss so that the crew could use it as a haven in case

edit columbia lifting off on its final mission the light-colored triangle visible at the base of the strut near the nose of the orbiter is the left bipod foam ramp video space shuttle external tank foam block close-up of the left bipod foam ramp that broke off and damaged the shuttle wing the shuttle s main fuel tank is covered in thermal insulation foam intended to prevent ice from forming when the tank is full of liquid hydrogen and oxygen such ice could damage the shuttle if shed during lift-off mission sts-107 was the 113th space shuttle launch planned to begin on january 11, 2001, the mission was delayed 18 times 5 and eventually launched on january 16, 2003, following sts-113 the columbia accident investigation board determined that this delay had nothing to do with the catastrophic failure 5 about 82 seconds after launch from kennedy space center s lc-39-a a suitcase-sized piece of foam broke off from the external tank et  striking columbia s left wing reinforced carbon-carbon rcc panels as demonstrated by ground experiments conducted by the columbia accident investigation board this likely created a 6-to-10-inch 15 to 25 cm diameter hole allowing hot gases to enter the wing when columbia later re-entered the atmosphere at the time of the foam strike the orbiter was at an altitude of about 66,000 feet 20 km 12.5 mi  traveling at mach 2.46 1,626 miles per hour or 727 meters per second  the left bipod foam ramp is an approximately three-foot one-meter long aerodynamic component made entirely of foam the foam not normally considered to be a structural material is required to bear some aerodynamic loads because of these special requirements the casting-in-place and curing of the ramps may be performed only by a senior technician 6 the bipod ramp having left and right sides was originally designed to reduce aerodynamic stresses around the bipod attachment points at the external tank but it was proven unnecessary in the wake of the accident and was removed from the external tank design for tanks flown after sts-107 another foam ramp along the liquid oxygen line was also later removed from the tank design to eliminate it as a foam debris source after analysis and tests proved this change safe  bipod ramp insulation had been observed falling off in whole or in part on four previous flights sts-7 1983  sts-32 1990  sts-50 1992 and most recently sts-112 just two launches before sts-107  all affected shuttle missions completed successfully nasa management came to refer to this phenomenon as foam shedding  as with the o-ring erosion problems that ultimately doomed the space shuttle challenger nasa management became accustomed to these phenomena when no serious consequences resulted from these earlier episodes this phenomenon was termed normalization of deviance by sociologist diane vaughan in her book on the challenger launch decision process 7 as it happened sts-112 had been the first flight with the et cam  a video feed mounted on the et for the purpose of giving greater insight to the foam shedding problem during that launch a chunk of foam broke away from the et bipod ramp and hit the srb-et attach ring near the bottom of the left solid rocket booster srb causing a dent four inches wide and three inches deep in it 8 after sts-112 nasa leaders analyzed the situation and decided to press ahead under the justification that t he et is safe to fly with no new concerns and no added risk of further foam strikes 9 video taken during lift-off of sts-107 was routinely reviewed two hours later and revealed nothing unusual the following day higher-resolution film that had been processed overnight revealed the foam debris striking the left wing potentially damaging the thermal protection on the space shuttle 10 at the time the exact location where the foam struck the wing could not be determined due to the low resolution of the tracking camera footage meanwhile nasa s judgment about the risks was revisited linda ham chair of the mission management team mmt  said rationale was lousy then and still is ham and shuttle program manager ron dittemore had both been present at the october 31, 2002, meeting where the decision to continue with launches was made 11 post-disaster analysis revealed that two previous shuttle launches sts-52 and -62 also had bipod ramp foam loss that went undetected in addition protuberance air load pal ramp foam had also shed pieces and there were also spot losses from large-area foams flight risk management edit in a risk-management scenario similar to the challenger disaster nasa management failed to recognize the relevance of engineering concerns for safety and suggestions for imaging to inspect possible damage and failed to respond to engineers requests about the status of astronaut inspection of the left wing engineers made three separate requests for department of defense dod imaging of the shuttle in orbit to determine damage more precisely while the images were not guaranteed to show the damage the capability existed for imaging of sufficient resolution to provide meaningful examination nasa management did not honor the requests and in some cases intervened to stop the dod from assisting 12 the caib recommended subsequent shuttle flights be imaged while in orbit using ground-based or space-based dod assets 13 details of the dod s unfulfilled participation with columbia remain secret retired nasa official wayne hale stated in 2012 that activity regarding other national assets and agencies remains classified and i cannot comment on that aspect of the columbia tragedy  14 throughout the risk assessment process senior nasa managers were influenced by their belief that nothing could be done even if damage were detected this affected their stance on investigation urgency thoroughness and possible contingency actions they decided to conduct a parametric what-if scenario study more suited to determine risk probabilities of future events instead of inspecting and assessing the actual damage the investigation report in particular singled out nasa manager linda ham for exhibiting this attitude 15 in 2013, hale recalled that director of mission operations jon c harpold told him before columbia s destruction you know there is nothing we can do about damage to the tps thermal protection system  if it has been damaged it s probably better not to know i think the crew would rather not know don t you think it would be better for them to have a happy successful flight and die unexpectedly during entry than to stay on orbit knowing that there was nothing to be done until the air ran out 16 much of the risk assessment hinged on damage predictions to the thermal protection system these fall into two categories damage to the silica tile on the wing lower surface and damage to the reinforced carbon-carbon rcc leading-edge panels the tps includes a third category of components thermal insulating blankets but damage predictions are not typically performed on them damage assessments on the thermal blankets can be performed after an anomaly has been observed and this has been done at least once after the return to flight following columbia s loss before the flight nasa believed that the rcc was very durable charles f bolden who worked on tile-damage scenarios and repair methods early in his astronaut career said in 2004 that 17 never did we talk about the rcc because we all thought that it was impenetrable . i spent fourteen years in the space program flying thinking that i had this huge mass that was about five or six inches thick on the leading edge of the wing and to find after columbia that it was fractions of an inch thick and that it wasn t as strong as the fiberglass on your corvette that was an eye-opener and i think for all of us . the best minds that i know of in and outside of nasa never envisioned that as a failure mode damage-prediction software was used to evaluate possible tile and rcc damage the tool for predicting tile damage was known as crater  described by several nasa representatives in press briefings as not actually a software program but rather a statistical spreadsheet of observed past flight events and effects the crater tool predicted severe penetration of multiple tiles by the impact if it struck the tps tile area but nasa engineers downplayed this it had been shown that the model overstated damage from small projectiles and engineers believed that the model would also overstate damage from larger spray-on foam insulation sofi impacts the program used to predict rcc damage was based on small ice impacts the size of cigarette butts not larger sofi impacts as the ice impacts were the only recognized threats to rcc panels up to that point under one of 15 predicted sofi impact paths the software predicted an ice impact would completely penetrate the rcc panel engineers downplayed this too believing that impacts of the less dense sofi material would result in less damage than ice impacts in an e-mail exchange nasa managers questioned whether the density of the sofi could be used as justification for reducing predicted damage despite engineering concerns about the energy imparted by the sofi material nasa managers ultimately accepted the rationale to reduce predicted damage of the rcc panels from possible complete penetration to slight damage to the panel s thin coating 18 ultimately the nasa mission management team felt there was insufficient evidence to indicate that the strike was an unsafe situation so they declared the debris strike a turnaround issue not of highest importance and denied the requests for the department of defense images on january 23, flight director steve stich sent an e-mail to columbia informing commander husband and pilot mccool of the foam strike while unequivocally dismissing any concerns about entry safety 19 20 during ascent at approximately 80 seconds photo analysis shows that some debris from the area of the -y et bipod attach point came loose and subsequently impacted the orbiter left wing in the area of transition from chine to main wing creating a shower of smaller particles the impact appears to be totally on the lower surface and no particles are seen to traverse over the upper surface of the wing experts have reviewed the high speed photography and there is no concern for rcc or tile damage we have seen this same phenomenon on several other flights and there is absolutely no concern for entry 21 edward tufte an expert in information design and presentation 22 remarked on poor modes of communication during the assessment made on the ground before columbia s reentry nasa and boeing favored microsoft powerpoint for conveying information powerpoint uses multi-level bullet points and orients towards single-page-of-information groupings this is not ideal for complex scientific and engineering reports and may have caused recipients to draw incorrect conclusions in particular the slide format may have emphasized optimistic options and glossed over the more accurate pessimistic viewpoints 23 re-entry timeline edit columbia was scheduled to land at 9 16 a.m est 2 30 a.m est february 1, 2003 the entry flight control team began duty in the mission control center known today as the christopher c kraft jr mission control center  the flight control team had not been working on any issues or problems related to the planned de-orbit and re-entry of columbia in particular the team had indicated no concerns about the debris that hit the left wing during ascent and treated the re-entry like any other the team worked through the de-orbit preparation checklist and re-entry checklist procedures weather forecasters with the help of pilots in the shuttle training aircraft evaluated landing-site weather conditions at the kennedy space center 8 00 mission control center entry flight director leroy cain polled the mission control room for a go no-go decision for the de-orbit burn all weather observations and forecasts were within guidelines set by the flight rules and all systems were normal 8 10 the capsule communicator capcom told the crew that they were go for de-orbit burn 8 15 30 ei-1719 husband and mccool executed the de-orbit burn using columbia’s two orbital maneuvering system engines the orbiter was upside down and tail-first over the indian ocean at an altitude of 175 miles 282 km and speed of 17,500 miles per hour 7.8 km s when the burn was executed a 2-minute 38-second de-orbit burn during the 255th orbit slowed the orbiter to begin its re-entry into the atmosphere the burn proceeded normally putting the crew under about one-tenth gravity husband then turned columbia right side up facing forward with the nose pitched up 8 44 09 ei 000 entry interface ei  arbitrarily defined as the point at which the orbiter entered the discernible atmosphere at 400,000 feet 120 km 76 mi  occurred over the pacific ocean as columbia descended the heat of reentry caused wing leading-edge temperatures to rise steadily reaching an estimated 2,500 °f 1,370 °c during the next six minutes as former space shuttle program manager wayne hale said in a press briefing about 90 of this heating is the result of compression of the atmospheric gas caused by the orbiter s supersonic flight rather than the result of friction columbia at about 8 57. debris is visible coming from the left wing bottom  the image was taken at starfire optical range at kirtland air force base 8 48 39 ei 270 a sensor on the left wing leading edge spar showed strains higher than those seen on previous columbia re-entries this was recorded only on the modular auxiliary data system which is similar in concept to a flight data recorder and was not sent to ground controllers or shown to the crew 8 49 32 ei 323 columbia executed a planned roll to the right speed mach 24.5. columbia began a banking turn to manage lift and therefore limit the orbiter s rate of descent and heating 8 50 53 ei 404 columbia entered a 10-minute period of peak heating during which the thermal stresses were at their maximum speed mach 24.1 altitude 243,000 feet 74 km 46.0 mi  8 52 00 ei 471 columbia was about 300 miles 480 km west of the california coastline the wing leading-edge temperatures usually reached 2,650 °f 1,450 °c at this point 8 53 26 ei 557 columbia crossed the california coast west of sacramento speed mach 23 altitude 231,600 feet 70.6 km 43.86 mi  columbia debris in red orange and yellow detected by national weather service radar over texas and louisiana the orbiter s wing leading edge typically reached more than 2,800 °f 1,540 °c at this point 8 53 46 ei 577 various people on the ground saw signs of debris being shed speed mach 22.8 altitude 230,200 feet 70.2 km 43.60 mi  the superheated air surrounding the orbiter suddenly brightened causing a streak in the orbiter s luminescent trail that was quite noticeable in the pre-dawn skies over the west coast observers witnessed four similar events during the following 23 seconds dialogue on some of the amateur footage indicates the observers were aware of the abnormality of what they were filming 8 54 24 ei 615 the maintenance mechanical and crew systems mmacs officer told the flight director that four hydraulic sensors in the left wing were indicating off-scale low  in mission control re-entry had been proceeding normally up to this point off-scale low is a reading that falls below the minimum capability of the sensor and it usually indicates that the sensor has stopped functioning due to internal or external factors not that the quantity it measures is actually below the sensor s minimum response value 8 54 25 ei 616 columbia crossed from california into nevada airspace speed mach 22.5 altitude 227,400 feet 69.3 km 43.07 mi  witnesses observed a bright flash at this point and 18 similar events in the next four minutes 8 55 00 ei 651 nearly 11 minutes after columbia re-entered the atmosphere wing leading-edge temperatures normally reached nearly 3,000 °f 1,650 °c  8 55 32 ei 683 columbia crossed from nevada into utah speed mach 21.8 altitude 223,400 feet 68.1 km 42.31 mi  8 55 52 ei 703 columbia crossed from utah into arizona 8 56 30 ei 741 columbia began a roll reversal turning from right to left over arizona 8 56 45 ei 756 columbia crossed from arizona to new mexico speed mach 20.9 altitude 219,000 feet 67 km 41.5 mi  8 57 24 ei 795 columbia passed just north of albuquerque 8 58 00 ei 831 at this point wing leading-edge temperatures typically decreased to 2,880 °f 1,580 °c  8 58 20 ei 851 columbia crossed from new mexico into texas speed mach 19.5 altitude 209,800 feet 63.9 km 39.73 mi  at about this time the orbiter shed a thermal protection system tile the most westerly piece of debris that has been recovered searchers found the tile in a field in littlefield texas just northwest of lubbock 8 59 15 ei 906 mmacs told the flight director that pressure readings had been lost on both left main landing-gear tires the flight director then instructed the capsule communicator capcom to let the crew know that mission control saw the messages and was evaluating the indications and added that the flight control team did not understand the crew s last transmission 8 59 32 ei 923 a broken response from the mission commander was recorded roger uh bu – cut off in mid-word . it was the last communication from the crew and the last telemetry signal received in mission control 8 59 37 ei 928 hydraulic pressure which is required to move the flight control surfaces was lost at about 8 59 37. at that time the master alarm would have sounded for the loss of hydraulics and the shuttle would have begun to lose control starting to roll and yaw uncontrollably and the crew would have become aware of the serious problem 24 9 00 18 ei 969 videos and eyewitness reports by observers on the ground in and near dallas indicated that the orbiter had disintegrated overhead continued to break up into smaller pieces and left multiple ion trails as it continued eastward in mission control while the loss of signal was a cause for concern there was no sign of any serious problem before the orbiter broke up at 9 00 18, the columbia cabin pressure was nominal and the crew was capable of conscious actions 24 although the crew module remained mostly intact through the breakup it was damaged enough that it lost pressure at a rate fast enough to incapacitate the crew within seconds 25 and was completely depressurized no later than 9 00 53. 9 00 57 ei 1008 the crew module intact to this point was seen breaking into small subcomponents it disappeared from view at 9 01 10. the crew if not already dead were killed no later than this point 9 05 residents of north central texas particularly near tyler reported a loud boom a small concussion wave smoke trails and debris in the clear skies above the counties east of dallas 9 12 39 ei 1710 after hearing of reports of the shuttle being seen to break apart entry flight director leroy cain declared a contingency events leading to loss of the vehicle and alerted search-and-rescue teams in the debris area he called on the ground controller to lock the doors  meaning no one would be permitted to enter or leave until everything needed for investigation of the accident had been secured 26 two minutes later mission control put contingency procedures into effect crew survivability aspects edit in 2008, nasa released a detailed report on survivability aspects of the columbia reentry the crew would have had less than a minute between the beginning of orbiter disintegration and depressurization the structural failure of the left wing set off alarms in the cabin although they had no way of knowing that the wing had broken apart as the rear of the orbiter could not be seen from the cabin all evidence indicated that the crew frantically tried to regain control of columbia as it began to spin out of control but the loss of the left wing caused the orbiter to yaw to the right exposing its underside to extreme aerodynamic forces and causing total structural disintegration the crew cabin separated from the rest of the orbiter and rapidly depressurized which would have killed or incapacitated the astronauts within seconds afterwards the cabin spun around at high rpm which caused the seat restraints on their upper bodies to fail they were thus whipped around violently and pummeled by flying and falling objects from the disintegrating cabin along with their heads and necks being slammed against the helmets which were not designed to provide any head protection even if the cabin had remained structurally intact and reached a lower altitude where air could refill it the high altitude depressurization would have been fatal to the astronauts unless they received medical attention within 5 minutes approximately the amount of time it would take between cerebral hypoxia and brain death after cabin disintegration the astronauts bodies were released into the upper atmosphere and battered by extreme aerodynamic forces close to 14,000 mph and temperatures the remains of the crew then fell some 200,000 feet to earth where they were also subjected to burning from aerodynamic heating the official nasa report omitted some of the more graphic details on the recovery of the remains however witnesses reported various gruesome finds such as a human heart and parts of femur bones 27 all evidence indicated that crew error was in no way responsible for the disintegration of the orbiter and they had acted correctly and according to procedure at the first indication of trouble although some of the crew were not wearing gloves or helmets during reentry and some were not properly restrained in their seats doing these things would have added nothing to their survival chances other than perhaps keeping them alive and conscious another 30 or so seconds 28 presidential response edit president george w bush s address on the columbia s destruction february 1, 2003 at 14 04 est 19 04 utc  president george w bush said this day has brought terrible news and great sadness to our country . the columbia is lost there are no survivors  despite the disaster bush said the cause in which they died will continue....our journey into space will go on  29 bush later declared east texas a federal disaster area allowing federal agencies to help with the recovery effort 30 recovery of debris edit a grid on the floor is used to organize recovered debris recovered power-head of one of columbia s main engines more than 2,000 debris fields were found in sparsely populated areas from nacogdoches in east texas where a large amount of debris fell to western louisiana and the southwestern counties of arkansas a large amount of debris was recovered between tyler texas and palestine texas one debris field has been mapped along a path stretching from south of fort worth to hemphill texas as well as into parts of louisiana 31 various notable places that had debris included stephen f austin state university in nacogdoches and several casinos in shreveport louisiana 31 along with pieces of the shuttle and bits of equipment searchers also found human body parts including arms feet a torso and a heart 32 in the months after the disaster the largest-ever organized ground search took place 33 thousands of volunteers descended upon texas to participate in the effort to gather the shuttle’s remains according to mike ciannilli project manager of the columbia research and preservation office these people put their life on hold to help out the nation’s space program,” showing “what space means to people.” 34 nasa issued warnings to the public that any debris could contain hazardous chemicals that it should be left untouched its location reported to local emergency services or government authorities and that anyone in unauthorized possession of debris would be prosecuted because of the widespread area volunteer amateur radio operators accompanied the search teams to provide communications support 35 a group of small 1 mm adult caenorhabditis elegans worms living in petri dishes enclosed in aluminum canisters survived reentry and impact with the ground and were recovered weeks after the disaster 36 37 the culture was found to be alive on april 28, 2003. 38 the worms were part of a biological research in canisters experiment designed to study the effect of weightlessness on physiology the experiment was conducted by cassie conley nasa s planetary protection officer debris search pilot jules f mier jr and debris search aviation specialist charles krenek died in a helicopter crash that injured three others during the search 39 some texas residents recovered some of the debris ignoring the warnings and attempted to sell it on the online auction site ebay starting at 10,000. the auction was quickly removed but prices for columbia merchandise such as programs photographs and patches went up dramatically following the disaster creating a surge of columbia-related listings 40 a three-day amnesty offered for looted shuttle debris brought in hundreds of illegally recovered pieces 41 about 40,000 recovered pieces of debris have never been identified the largest pieces recovered include the front landing gear 42 and a window frame 43 the glow of reentry as seen out the front windows on may 9, 2008, it was reported that data from a disk drive on board columbia had survived the shuttle accident and while part of the 340 mb drive was damaged 99 of the data was recovered 44 the drive was used to store data from an experiment on the properties of shear thinning 45 on july 29, 2011, nacogdoches authorities told nasa that a 4-foot 1.2 m diameter piece of debris had been found in a lake nasa identified the piece as a power reactant storage and distribution prsd  46 not in citation given all recovered non-human columbia debris is stored in unused office space at the vehicle assembly building except for parts of the crew compartment which are kept separate 47 crew cabin video edit play media video taken by the crew of part of re-entry among the recovered items was a videotape recording made by the astronauts during the start of re-entry the 13-minute recording shows the flight crew astronauts conducting routine re-entry procedures and joking with each other none gives any indication of a problem in the video the flight-deck crew puts on their gloves and passes the video camera around to record plasma and flames visible outside the windows of the orbiter a normal occurrence  the recording which on normal flights would have continued through landing ends about four minutes before the shuttle began to disintegrate and 11 minutes before mission control lost the signal from the orbiter 48 investigation edit initial investigation edit mock-up of a space shuttle leading edge made with an rcc-panel taken from discovery simulation of known and possible conditions of the foam impact on columbia s final launch showed brittle fracture of rcc nasa space shuttle program manager ron dittemore reported that the first indication was loss of temperature sensors and hydraulic systems on the left wing they were followed seconds and minutes later by several other problems including loss of tire pressure indications on the left main gear and then indications of excessive structural heating  49 analysis of 31 seconds of telemetry data which had initially been filtered out because of data corruption within it showed the shuttle fighting to maintain its orientation eventually using maximum thrust from its reaction control system jets the investigation focused on the foam strike from the very beginning incidents of debris strikes from ice and foam causing damage during take-off were already well known and had damaged orbiters most noticeably during sts-45 sts-27 and sts-87 50 after the loss of columbia nasa concluded that mistakes during installation were the likely cause of foam loss and retrained employees at michoud assembly facility in louisiana to apply foam without defects 14 tile damage had also been traced to ablating insulating material from the cryogenic fuel tank in the past the composition of the foam insulation had been changed in 1997 to exclude the use of freon a chemical that is suspected to cause ozone depletion while nasa was exempted from legislation phasing out cfcs the agency chose to change the foam nonetheless sts-107 used an older lightweight tank a design that was succeeded by the superlightweight tank  both being upgrades from the original space shuttle external tank where the foam was sprayed on to the larger cylindrical surfaces using the newer freon-free foam however the bipod ramps were manufactured from bx-250 foam which was excluded from the epa regulations and did use the original freon formula the composition change did not contribute to the accident 51 in any case the original formulation had shown frequent foam losses as discussed earlier in this article columbia accident investigation board edit main article columbia accident investigation board following protocols established after the loss of challenger an independent investigating board was created immediately after the accident the columbia accident investigation board or caib was chaired by retired us navy admiral harold w gehman jr. 52 and consisted of expert military and civilian analysts who investigated the accident in detail columbia s flight data recorder was found near hemphill texas on march 19, 2003. 53 unlike commercial jet aircraft the space shuttles did not have flight data recorders intended for after-crash analysis instead the vehicle data were transmitted in real time to the ground via telemetry since columbia was the first shuttle it had a special flight data oex orbiter experiments recorder designed to help engineers better understand vehicle performance during the first test flights after the initial shuttle test-flights were completed the recorder was never removed from columbia and it was still functioning on the crashed flight it recorded many hundreds of parameters and contained very extensive logs of structural and other data which allowed the caib to reconstruct many of the events during the process leading to breakup 54 investigators could often use the loss of signals from sensors on the wing to track how the damage progressed 55 this was correlated with forensic debris analysis conducted at lehigh university and other tests to obtain a final conclusion about the probable course of events 56 beginning on may 30, 2003, foam impact tests were performed by southwest research institute they used a compressed air gun to fire a foam block of similar size and mass to that which struck columbia at the same estimated speed to represent the leading edge of columbia s left wing rcc panels from nasa stock along with the actual leading-edge panels from enterprise which were fiberglass were mounted to a simulating structural metal frame at the beginning of testing the likely impact site was estimated to be between rcc panel 6 and 9, inclusive over many days dozens of the foam blocks were shot at the wing leading edge model at various angles these produced only cracks or surface damage to the rcc panels during june further analysis of information from columbia s flight data recorder narrowed the probable impact site to one single panel rcc wing panel 8. on july 7, in a final round of testing a block fired at the side of an rcc panel 8 created a hole 16 by 16.7 inches 41 by 42 cm in that protective rcc panel 57 the tests demonstrated that a foam impact of the type columbia sustained could seriously breach the thermal protection system on the wing leading edge 58 conclusions edit on august 26, 2003, the caib issued its report on the accident the report confirmed the immediate cause of the accident was a breach in the leading edge of the left wing caused by insulating foam shed during launch the report also delved deeply into the underlying organizational and cultural issues that led to the accident the report was highly critical of nasa s decision-making and risk-assessment processes it concluded the organizational structure and processes were sufficiently flawed and that a compromise of safety was expected no matter who was in the key decision-making positions an example was the position of shuttle program manager where one individual was responsible for achieving safe timely launches and acceptable costs which are often conflicting goals the caib report found that nasa had accepted deviations from design criteria as normal when they happened on several flights and did not lead to mission-compromising consequences one of those was the conflict between a design specification stating that the thermal protection system was not designed to withstand significant impacts and the common occurrence of impact damage to it during flight the board made recommendations for significant changes in processes and organizational culture on december 30, 2008, nasa released a further report entitled columbia crew survival investigation report produced by a second commission the spacecraft crew survival integrated investigation team scsiit  nasa had commissioned this group to perform a comprehensive analysis of the accident focusing on factors and events affecting crew survival and to develop recommendations for improving crew survival for all future human space flight vehicles 59 the report concluded that the columbia depressurization event occurred so rapidly that the crew members were incapacitated within seconds before they could configure the suit for full protection from loss of cabin pressure although circulatory systems functioned for a brief time the effects of the depressurization were severe enough that the crew could not have regained consciousness this event was lethal to the crew the report also concluded the crew did not have time to prepare themselves some crew members were not wearing their safety gloves and one crew member was not wearing a helmet new policies gave the crew more time to prepare for descent the crew s safety harnesses malfunctioned during the violent descent the harnesses on the three remaining shuttles were upgraded after the accident the key recommendations of the report included that future spacecraft crew survival systems should not rely on manual activation to protect the crew 60 possible emergency procedures edit one question of special importance was whether nasa could have saved the astronauts had they known of the danger 61 this would have to involve either rescue or repair – docking at the international space station for use as a haven while awaiting rescue or to use the soyuz to systematically ferry the crew to safety would have been impossible due to the different orbital inclination of the vehicles the caib determined that a rescue mission though risky might have been possible provided nasa management had taken action soon enough 62 63 normally a rescue mission is not possible due to the time required to prepare a shuttle for launch and the limited consumables power water air of an orbiting shuttle however atlantis was well along in processing for a planned march 1 launch on sts-114 and columbia carried an unusually large quantity of consumables due to an extended duration orbiter package the caib determined that this would have allowed columbia to stay in orbit until flight day 30 february 15  nasa investigators determined that atlantis processing could have been expedited with no skipped safety checks for a february 10 launch hence if nothing went wrong there was a five-day overlap for a possible rescue as mission control could deorbit an empty shuttle but could not control the orbiter s reentry and landing it would likely have sent columbia into the pacific ocean 63 nasa later developed the remote control orbiter system to permit mission control to land a shuttle nasa investigators determined that on-orbit repair by the shuttle astronauts was possible but overall considered high risk  primarily due to the uncertain resiliency of the repair using available materials and the anticipated high risk of doing additional damage to the orbiter 62 63 columbia did not carry the canadarm or remote manipulator system which would normally be used for camera inspection or transporting a spacewalking astronaut to the wing therefore an unusual emergency extra-vehicular activity eva would have been required while there was no astronaut eva training for maneuvering to the wing astronauts are always prepared for a similarly difficult emergency eva to close the external tank umbilical doors located on the orbiter underside which is necessary for reentry similar methods could have reached the shuttle left wing for inspection or repair 63 for the repair the caib determined that the astronauts would have to use tools and small pieces of titanium or other metal scavenged from the crew cabin these metals would help protect the wing structure and would be held in place during re-entry by a water-filled bag that had turned into ice in the cold of space the ice and metal would help restore wing leading edge geometry preventing a turbulent airflow over the wing and therefore keeping heating and burn-through levels low enough for the crew to survive re-entry and bail out before landing the caib could not determine whether a patched-up left wing would have survived even a modified re-entry and concluded that the rescue option would have had a considerably higher chance of bringing columbia s crew back alive 62 63 memorials edit on february 4, 2003, president george w bush and his wife laura led a memorial service for the astronauts families at the lyndon b johnson space center two days later vice president dick cheney and his wife lynne led a similar service at washington national cathedral patti

columbia colles a range of hills on pluto discovered by the new horizons spacecraft in july 2015, was named in honor of the victims of the disaster 80 a starship on star trek enterprise was named u.s.s columbia in honor of the columbia effect on space programs edit following the loss of columbia the space shuttle program was suspended 55 the further construction of the international space station iss was also delayed as the space shuttles were the only available delivery vehicle for station modules the station was supplied using russian unmanned progress ships and crews were exchanged using russian-manned soyuz spacecraft and forced to operate on a skeleton crew of two 81 82 less than a year after the accident president bush announced the vision for space exploration calling for the space shuttle fleet to complete the iss with retirement by the year 2010 following the completion of the iss to be replaced by a newly developed crew exploration vehicle for travel to the moon and mars 83 nasa planned to return the space shuttle to service around september 2004 that date was pushed back to july 2005. on july 26, 2005, at 10 39 am est space shuttle discovery cleared the tower on the return to flight mission sts-114 marking the shuttle s return to space overall the sts-114 flight was highly successful but a similar piece of foam from a different portion of the tank was shed although the debris did not strike the orbiter due to this nasa once again grounded the shuttles until the remaining problem was understood and a solution implemented 55 after delaying their re-entry by two days due to adverse weather conditions commander eileen collins and pilot james m kelly returned discovery safely to earth on august 9, 2005. later that same month the external tank construction site at michoud was damaged by hurricane katrina 84 at the time there was concern that this would set back further shuttle flights by at least two months and possibly more the actual cause of the foam loss on both columbia and discovery was not determined until december 2005, when x-ray photographs of another tank showed that thermal expansion and contraction during filling not human error caused cracks that led to foam loss nasa s hale formally apologized to the michoud workers who had been blamed for the loss of columbia for almost three years 14 the second return to flight mission sts-121 launched on july 4, 2006, at 2 37 55 pm edt  after two previous launch attempts were scrubbed because of lingering thunderstorms and high winds around the launch pad the launch took place despite objections from its chief engineer and safety head this mission increased the iss crew to three a 5-inch 130 mm crack in the foam insulation of the external tank gave cause for concern however the mission management team gave the go for launch 85 space shuttle discovery touched down successfully on july 17, 2006 at 9 14 43 am edt on runway 15 at the kennedy space center on august 13, 2006, nasa announced that sts-121 had shed more foam than they had expected while this did not delay the launch for the next mission – sts-115 originally set to lift off on august 27 86 – the weather and other technical glitches did with a lightning strike hurricane ernesto and a faulty fuel tank sensor combining to delay the launch until september 9. on september 19, landing was delayed an extra day to examine atlantis after objects were found floating near the shuttle in the same orbit when no damage was detected atlantis landed successfully on september 21. the columbia crew survival investigation report released by nasa on december 30, 2008, made further recommendations to improve a crew s survival chances on future space vehicles such as the planned orion spacecraft these included improvements in crew restraints finding ways to deal more effectively with catastrophic cabin depressurization more graceful degradation of vehicles during a disaster so that crews will have a better chance at survival and automated parachute systems 59 sociocultural aftermath edit fears of terrorism edit after the shuttle s breakup there were some initial fears that terrorists might have been involved but no evidence of that has ever surfaced 87 security surrounding the launch and landing of the space shuttle had been increased because the crew included the first israeli astronaut 88 the merritt island launch facility like all sensitive government areas had increased security after the september 11 attacks purple streak image edit the san francisco chronicle reported that an amateur astronomer had taken a five-second exposure that appeared to show a purplish line near the shuttle  resembling lightning during re-entry 89 the caib report concluded that the image was the result of camera vibrations during a long-exposure  90 2003 armageddon film hoax edit in response to the disaster fx canceled its scheduled airing two nights later of the 1998 film armageddon in which the space shuttle atlantis is depicted as being destroyed by asteroid fragments 91 in a hoax inspired by the destruction of columbia some images that were purported to be satellite photographs of the shuttle s explosion turned out to be screen captures from the space shuttle destruction scene of armageddon music edit the 2003 album bananas by deep purple includes contact lost  an instrumental piece written by guitarist steve morse in remembrance of the loss morse is donating his songwriting royalties to the families of the astronauts 92 catherine faber and callie hills the folk group known as echo s children included a memorial song titled columbia on their 2004 album from the hazel tree 93 the 2005 album ultimatum – ep by the long winters contains the song the commander thinks aloud  which was songwriter singer john roderick s musing on the crew s perspective of the unexpected catastrophe 94 in addition the january 30, 2015 episode of hrishikesh hirway s song exploder podcast presented an interview with john roderick about the songwriting and recording process for the commander thinks aloud  95 swiss post-rock band the evpatoria report used the records of radio communication between columbia and capcom as a sample for their instrumental song taijin kyofusho on their 2005 album golevka the hungarian composer peter eötvös wrote a piece named seven for solo violin and orchestra in 2006 in memory of the crew of columbia seven was premiered in 2007 by violinist akiko suwanai conducted by pierre boulez and it was recorded in 2012 with violinist patricia kopatchinskaja and the composer conducting 96 the 2008 album columbia we dare to dream by anne cabrera was written as a tribute to space shuttle columbia sts-107 the crew support teams recovery teams and the crew s families 97 a copy of the album on compact disc was flown aboard space shuttle discovery mission sts-131 to the international space station by astronaut clayton anderson in april 2010. 98 the scottish folk-rock band runrig included a song entitled somewhere on their album the story 2016 the song was dedicated to laurel clark who had become a fan of the band during her navy service in scotland  and includes a piece of her wake up song followed by some radio chatter at the end 99
