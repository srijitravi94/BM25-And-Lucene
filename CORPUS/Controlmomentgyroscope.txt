cmg is an attitude control device generally used in spacecraft attitude control systems a cmg consists of a spinning rotor and one or more motorized gimbals that tilt the rotor’s angular momentum as the rotor tilts the changing angular momentum causes a gyroscopic torque that rotates the spacecraft mechanics edit cmgs differ from reaction wheels the latter apply torque simply by changing rotor spin speed but the former tilt the rotor s spin axis without necessarily changing its spin speed cmgs are also far more power efficient for a few hundred watts and about 100 kg of mass large cmgs have produced thousands of newton meters of torque a reaction wheel of similar capability would require megawatts of power 1 design varieties edit single-gimbal edit the most effective cmgs include only a single gimbal when the gimbal of such a cmg rotates the change in direction of the rotor s angular momentum represents a torque that reacts onto the body to which the cmg is mounted e.g a spacecraft except for effects due to the motion of the spacecraft this torque is due to a constraint so it does no mechanical work i.e. requires no energy  single-gimbal cmgs exchange angular momentum in a way that requires very little power with the result that they can apply very large torques for minimal electrical input dual-gimbal edit such a cmg includes two gimbals per rotor as an actuator it is more versatile than a single-gimbal cmg because it is capable of pointing the rotor s momentum vector in any direction however the torque generated by one gimbal s motion must often be reacted by the other gimbal on its way to the spacecraft requiring more power for a given torque than a single-gimbal cmg if the goal is simply to store momentum in a mass-efficient way as in the case of the international space station dual-gimbal cmgs are a good design choice however if a spacecraft instead requires large output torque while consuming minimal power single-gimbal cmgs are a better choice variable-speed edit most cmgs hold rotor speed constant using relatively small motors to offset changes due to dynamic coupling and non-conservative effects some academic research has focused on the possibility of increasing and decreasing rotor speed while the cmg gimbals variable-speed cmgs vscmgs offer few practical advantages when considering actuation capability because the output torque from the rotor is typically much smaller than that caused by the gimbal motion the primary practical benefit of the vscmg when compared to the conventional cmg is an additional degree of freedom—afforded by the available rotor torque—which can be exploited for continuous cmg singularity avoidance and vscmg cluster reorientation research has shown that the rotor torques required for these two purposes are very small and within the capability of conventional cmg rotor motors 2 thus the practical benefits of vscmgs are readily available using conventional cmgs with alterations to cmg cluster steering and cmg rotor motor control laws the vscmg also can be used as a mechanical battery to store electric energy as kinetic energy of the flywheels potential problems edit singularities edit at least three single-axis cmgs are necessary for control of spacecraft attitude however no matter how many cmgs a spacecraft uses gimbal motion can lead to relative orientations that produce no usable output torque along certain directions these orientations are known as singularities and are related to the kinematics of robotic systems that encounter limits on the end-effector velocities due to certain joint alignments avoiding these singularities is naturally of great interest and several techniques have been proposed david bailey and others have argued in patents and in academic publications that merely avoiding the divide by zero error that is associated with these singularities is sufficient 3 4 two more recent patents summarize competing approaches 5 6 see also gimbal lock saturation edit a cluster of cmgs can become saturated in the sense that it is holding a maximum amount of angular momentum in a particular direction and can hold no more as an example suppose a spacecraft equipped with two or more dual-gimbal cmgs experiences a transient unwanted torque perhaps caused by reaction from venting waste gas tending to make it roll clockwise about its forward axis and thus increase its angular momentum along that axis then the cmg control program will command the gimbal motors of the cmgs to slant the rotors spin axes gradually more and more forward so that the angular momentum vectors of the rotors point more nearly along the forward axis while this gradual change in rotor spin direction is in progress the rotors will be creating gyroscopic torques whose resultant is anticlockwise about the forward axis holding the spacecraft steady against the unwanted waste gas torque when the transient torque ends the control program will stop the gimbal movement and the rotors will be left pointing more forward than before the inflow of unwanted forward angular momentum has been routed through the cmgs and dumped into the rotors the forward component of their total angular momentum vector is now greater than before if these events are repeated the angular momentum vectors of the individual rotors will bunch more and more closely together round the forward direction in the limiting case they will all end up parallel and the cmg cluster will now be saturated in that direction it can hold no more angular momentum if the cmgs were initially holding no angular momentum about any other axes they will end up saturated exactly along the forward axis if however for example they were already holding a little angular momentum in the up yaw left direction they will saturate end up parallel along an axis pointing forward and slightly up and so on saturation is possible about any axis in the saturated condition attitude control is impossible since the gyroscopic torques can now only be created at right angles to the saturation axis roll control about that axis itself is now non-existent there will also be major difficulties with control about other axes for example an unwanted left yaw can only be countered by storing some up angular momentum in the cmg rotors this can only be done by tilting at least one of their axes up which will slightly reduce the forward component of their total angular momentum since they can now store less right roll forward angular momentum they will have to release some back into the spacecraft which will be forced to start an unwanted roll to the right a the only remedy for this loss of control is to desaturate the cmgs by removing the excess angular momentum from the spacecraft the simplest way of doing this is to use reaction control system rcs thrusters in our example of saturation along the forward axis the rcs will be fired to produce an anticlockwise torque about that axis the cmg control program will then command the rotor spin axes to begin fanning out away from the forward direction producing gyroscopic torques whose resultant is clockwise about the forward direction opposing the rcs as long as it is still firing and holding the spacecraft steady this is continued until a suitable amount of forward angular momentum has been drained out of the cmg rotors it is transformed into the moment of momentum of the moving matter in the rcs thruster exhausts and carried away from the spacecraft b it is worth noting that saturation can only apply to a cluster of two or more cmgs since it means that their rotor spins have become parallel it is meaningless to say that a single constant-speed cmg can become saturated in a sense it is permanently saturated in whatever direction the rotor happens to be pointing this contrasts with a single reaction wheel which can absorb more and more angular momentum along its fixed axis by spinning faster until it reaches saturation at its maximum design speed anti-parallel alignment edit there are other undesirable rotor axis configurations apart from saturation notably anti-parallel alignments for example if a spacecraft with two dual-gimbal cmgs gets into a state in which one rotor spin axis is facing directly forward while the other rotor spin is facing directly aft i.e anti-parallel to the first  then all roll control will be lost this happens for the same reason as for saturation the rotors can only produce gyroscopic torques at right angles to their spin axes and here these torques will have no fore-and-aft components and so no influence on roll however in this case the cmgs are not saturated at all their angular momenta are equal and opposite so the total stored angular momentum adds up to zero just as for saturation however and for exactly the same reasons roll control will become increasingly difficult if the cmgs even approach anti-parallel alignment in the anti-parallel configuration although roll control is lost control about other axes still works well in contrast to the situation with saturation  an unwanted left yaw can be dealt with by storing some up angular momentum which is easily done by tilting both rotor spin axes slightly up by equal amounts since their fore and aft components will still be equal and opposite there is no change in fore-and-aft angular momentum it will still be zero and therefore no unwanted roll in fact the situation will be improved because the rotor axes are no longer quite anti-parallel and some roll control will be restored anti-parallel alignment is therefore not quite as serious as saturation but must still be avoided it is theoretically possible with any number of cmgs as long as some rotors are aligned parallel along a particular axis and all the others point in exactly the opposite direction there is no saturation but still no roll control about that axis with three or more cmgs the situation can be immediately rectified simply by redistributing the existing total angular momentum among the rotors even if that total is zero  c in practice the cmg control program will continually redistribute the total angular momentum to avoid the situation arising in the first place if there are only two cmgs in the cluster as in our first example then anti-parallel alignment will inevitably occur if the total stored angular momentum reaches zero the remedy is to keep it away from zero possibly by using rcs firings this is not very satisfactory and in practice all spacecraft using cmgs are fitted with at least three however it sometimes happens that after malfunctions a cluster is left with only two working cmgs and the control program must be able to deal with this situation hitting the gimbal stops edit older cmg models like the ones launched with skylab in 1973 had limited gimbal travel between fixed mechanical stops on the skylab cmgs the limits were plus or minus 80 degrees from zero for the inner gimbals and from plus 220 degrees to minus 130 degrees for the outer ones so zero was offset by 45 degrees from the centre of travel  visualising the inner angle as latitude and the outer as longitude  it can be seen that for an individual cmg there were blind spots with radius 10 degrees of latitude at the north and south poles  and an additional blind strip of width 10 degrees of longitude running from pole to pole centred on the line of longitude at plus 135 degrees these blind areas represented directions in which the rotor s spin axis could never be pointed 7 11 skylab carried three cmgs mounted with their casings and therefore their rotor axes when the gimbals were set to zero facing in three mutually perpendicular directions this ensured that the six polar blind spots were spaced 90 degrees apart from each other the 45 degree zero offset then ensured that the three blind strips of the outer gimbals would pass halfway between neighbouring polar blind spots and at a maximum distance from each other the whole arrangement ensured that the blind areas of the three cmgs never overlapped and thus that at least two of the three rotor spins could be pointed in any given direction 7 4 the cmg control program was responsible for making sure that the gimbals never hit the stops by redistributing angular momentum between the three rotors to bring large gimbal angles closer to zero since the total angular momentum to be stored had only three degrees of freedom while the control program could change six independent variables the three pairs of gimbal angles  the program had sufficient freedom of action to do this while still obeying other constraints such as avoiding anti-parallel alignments 7 5 one advantage of limited gimbal movement such as skylab s is that singularities are less of a problem if skylab s inner gimbals had been able to reach 90 degrees or more away from zero then the north and south poles could have become singularities the gimbal stops prevented this more modern cmgs such as the four units installed on the iss in 2000 have unlimited gimbal travel and therefore no blind areas  thus they do not have to be mounted facing along mutually perpendicular directions the four units on the iss all face the same way the control program need not concern itself with gimbal stops but on the other hand it must pay more attention to avoiding singularities applications edit skylab edit skylab launched in may 1973, was the first spacecraft to be fitted with large cmgs for attitude control 8 three dual-gimbal cmgs were mounted on the equipment rack of the apollo telescope mount at the hub of the windmill-shaped array of solar panels on the side of the station they were arranged so that the casings and therefore the rotors when all gimbals were at their zero positions pointed in three mutually perpendicular directions since the units were dual-gimballed each one could produce a torque about any axis at right angles to its rotor axis thus providing some redundancy if any one of the three failed the combination of the remaining two could in general still produce a torque around any desired axis 7 gyrodynes on salyut and mir edit cmgs were used for attitude control on the salyut and mir space stations where they were called gyrodynes from the russian гиродин girodin this word is also sometimes used – especially by russian crew – for the cmgs on the iss  9 they were first tested on salyut 3 in 1974, and introduced as standard components from salyut 6 onwards 10 the completed mir station had twelve gyrodynes altogether starting with six in the pressurised interior of the kvant-1 module 11 these were later supplemented by another six on the unpressurised outside of kvant-2 according to npo energia putting them outside turned out to be a mistake as it made gyrodyne replacement much more difficult 12 international space station edit nasa personnel handle a single control moment gyroscope for the international space station the iss employs a total of four cmgs as primary actuating devices during normal flight mode operation the objective of the cmg flight control system is to hold the space station at a fixed attitude relative to the surface of the earth in addition it seeks a torque equilibrium attitude tea  in which the combined torque contribution of gravity gradient atmospheric drag solar pressure and geomagnetic interactions are minimized in the presence of these continual environmental disturbances cmgs absorb momentum in an attempt to maintain the space station at a desired attitude the cmgs will eventually saturate absorbing momentum to the point where they can absorb no more  resulting in loss of effectiveness of the cmg array for control some kind of momentum management scheme mms is necessary to allow the cmgs to hold a desired attitude and at the same time prevent cmg saturation since the cmgs are momentum-exchange devices external control torques must be used to desaturate the cmgs that is bring the momentum back to nominal value some methods for unloading cmg momentum include the use of magnetic torques reaction thrusters and gravity gradient torque for the space station the gravity gradient torque approach is preferred citation needed because it requires no consumables or external hardware and because the gravity-gradient torque on the iss can be very high 13 proposed edit as of 2016, the russian orbital segment of the iss carries no cmgs of its own however the proposed but as yet unbuilt science and power module nem-1 would be fitted with several externally-mounted cmgs 14 nem-1 would be installed on one of the lateral ports of the small um or nodal module scheduled for completion and launch at some time within the 2016–25 russian programme its twin nem-2 if completed would later be installed symmetrically on the other lateral um port on 24 february 2015, the scientific and technical council of roscosmos announced that after decommissioning of the iss then planned for 2024 the newer russian modules would be detached and form the nucleus of a small all-russian space station to be called opsek 15 16 if this plan is carried out the cmgs on nem-1 and nem-2 if built would provide attitude control for the new russian station control moment gyroscope cmg cmg drawing cover removed
