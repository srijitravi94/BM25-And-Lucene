emergency management - wikipedia emergency management from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from disaster preparedness jump to navigation search emergency management is the organization and management of resources and responsibilities for dealing with all humanitarian aspects of emergencies—preparedness response and recovery—in order to reduce the harmful effects of all hazards including disasters often interchanged with disaster management it is not be confused with it the world health organization defines an emergency as the state in which normal procedures are interrupted and immediate measures need to be taken to prevent that state turning into a disaster thus emergency management is crucial to avoid the disruption transforming into a disaster which is harder to recover

ranking or evaluation of risks responding to significant risks tolerate treat transfer terminate resourcing controls and planning reaction planning reporting monitoring risk performance reviewing the risk management framework there are a number of guidelines and publications regarding emergency planning published by various professional organizations such as asis national fire protection association nfpa  and the international association of emergency managers iaem  there are very few emergency management specific standards and emergency management as a discipline tends to fall under business resilience standards in order to avoid or reduce significant losses to a business emergency managers should work to identify and anticipate potential risks hopefully to reduce their probability of occurring in the event that an emergency does occur managers should have a plan prepared to mitigate the effects of that emergency as well as to ensure business continuity of critical operations post-incident it is essential for an organisation to include procedures for determining whether an emergency situation has occurred and at what point an emergency management plan should be

responders performs a training scenario involving anthrax emergency management plans and procedures should include the identification of appropriately trained staff members responsible for decision-making when an emergency occurs training plans should include internal people contractors and civil protection partners and should state the nature and frequency of training and testing testing of a plan s effectiveness should occur regularly in instances where several business or organisations occupy the same space joint emergency plans formally agreed to by all parties should be put into place drills and exercises in preparation for foreseeable hazards are often held with the participation of the services that will be involved in handling the emergency and people who will be affected drills are held to prepare for the hazards of fires tornadoes lockdown for protection earthquakes etc communicating and incident assessment edit communication is one of the key issues during any emergency pre-planning of communications is critical miscommunication can easily result in emergency events escalating unnecessarily once an emergency has been identified a comprehensive assessment evaluating the level of impact and its financial implications should be undertaken following assessment the appropriate plan or response to be activated will depend on a specific pre-set criteria within the emergency plan the steps necessary should be prioritized to ensure critical functions are operational as soon as possible the critical functions are those that makes the plan untenable if not operationalized the communication policy must be well known and rehearsed and all targeted audiences or publics and individuals must be alert all communication infrastructure must be as prepared as possible with all information on groupings clearly identified phases and personal activities edit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this

phases prevention mitigation preparedness response and recovery http www.fema.gov mission-areas prevention edit it focuses on preventing the human hazard primarily from potential natural disasters or terrorist attacks preventive measures are taken on both the domestic and international levels designed to provide permanent protection from disasters also by doing this the risk of loss of life and injury can be mitigated with good evacuation plans environmental planning and design standards in january 2005, 167 governments adopted a 10-year global plan for natural disaster risk reduction called the hyogo framework citation needed preventing or reducing the impacts of disasters on our communities is a key focus for emergency management efforts today prevention and mitigation also help reduce the financial costs of disaster response and recovery public safety canada is working with provincial and territorial governments and stakeholders to promote disaster prevention and mitigation using a risk-based and all-hazards approach in 2009, federal provincial territorial ministers endorsed a national disaster mitigation strategy mitigation strategy edit disaster mitigation measures are those that eliminate or reduce the impacts and risks of hazards through proactive measures taken before an emergency or disaster occurs preventive or mitigation measures take different forms for different types of disasters in earthquake prone areas these preventive measures might include structural changes such as the installation of an earthquake valve to instantly shut off the natural gas supply seismic retrofits of property and the securing of items inside a building the latter may include the mounting of furniture refrigerators water heaters and breakables to the walls and the addition of cabinet latches in flood prone areas houses can be built on poles stilts in areas prone to prolonged electricity black-outs installation of a generator ensures continuation of electrical service the construction of storm cellars and fallout shelters are further examples of personal mitigative actions on a national level governments might implement large scale mitigation measures after the monsoon floods of 2010, the punjab government subsequently constructed 22 disaster-resilient model villages comprising 1885 single-storey homes together with schools and health centres 3 one of the best known examples of investment in disaster mitigation is the red river floodway the building of the floodway was a joint provincial federal undertaking to protect the city of winnipeg and reduce the impact of flooding in the red river basin it cost 62.7 million to build in the 1960s since then the floodway has been used over 20 times its use during the 1997 red river flood alone saved an estimated 4.5 billion in costs from potential damage to the city 4 the floodway was expanded in 2006 as a joint provincial federal initiative preparedness edit an airport emergency preparedness exercise preparedness focuses on preparing equipment and procedures for use when a disaster occurs this equipment and these procedures can be used to reduce vulnerability to disaster to mitigate the impacts of a disaster or to respond more efficiently in an emergency the federal emergency management agency fema has set out a basic four-stage vision of preparedness flowing from mitigation to preparedness to response to recovery and back to mitigation in a circular planning process 5 this circular overlapping model has been modified by other agencies taught in emergency class and discussed in academic papers 6 fema also operates a building science branch that develops and produces multi-hazard mitigation guidance that focuses on creating disaster-resilient communities to reduce loss of life and property 7 fema advises citizens to prepare their homes with some emergency essentials in the case that the food distribution lines are interrupted fema has subsequently prepared for this contingency by purchasing hundreds of thousands of freeze dried food emergency meals ready to eat mre s to dispense to the communities where emergency shelter and evacuations are implemented some guidelines for household preparedness have been put online by the state of colorado on the topics of water food tools and so on 8 emergency preparedness can be difficult to measure 9 cdc focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of its public health efforts through a variety of measurement and assessment programs 10 local emergency planning committees edit local emergency planning committees lepcs are required by the united states environmental protection agency under the emergency planning and community right-to-know act to develop an emergency response plan review the plan at least annually and provide information about chemicals in the community to local citizens 11 this emergency preparedness effort focuses on hazards presented by use and storage of extremely hazardous and toxic chemicals 12 particular requirements of lepcs include identification of facilities and transportation routes of extremely hazardous substances description of emergency response procedures on and off site designation of a community coordinator and facility emergency coordinator s to implement the plan outline of emergency notification procedures description of how to determine the probable affected area and population by releases description of local emergency equipment and facilities and the persons responsible for them outline of evacuation plans a training program for emergency responders including schedules methods and schedules for exercising emergency response plans according to the epa many lepcs have expanded their activities beyond the requirements of epcra encouraging accident prevention and risk reduction and addressing homeland security in their communities and the agency offers advice on how to evaluate the effectiveness of these committees 13 preparedness measures edit

broader government-based all hazard planning 14 there are a number of preparedness stages between all hazard and individual planning generally involving some combination of both mitigation and response planning business continuity planning encourages businesses to have a disaster recovery plan community- and faith-based organizations mitigation efforts promote field response teams and inter-agency planning 15 classroom response kit school-based response teams cover everything from live shooters to gas leaks and nearby bank robberies 16 educational institutions plan for cyberattacks and windstorms 17 industry specific guidance exists for horse farms 18 boat owners 19 and more family preparedness for disaster is fairly unusual a 2013 survey found that only 19 of american families felt that they were very prepared for a disaster 20 still there are many resources available for family disaster planning the department of homeland security s ready.gov page includes a family emergency plan checklist 21 has a whole webpage devoted to readiness for kids complete with cartoon-style superheroes 22 and ran a thunderclap campaign in 2014. 23 the center for disease control has a zombie apocalypse website 24 kitchen fire extinguisher disasters take a variety of forms to include earthquakes tsunamis or regular structure fires that a disaster or emergency is not large scale in terms of population or acreage impacted or duration does not make it any less of a disaster for the people or area impacted and much can be learned about preparedness from so-called small disasters 25 the red cross states that it responds to nearly 70,000 disasters a year the most common of which is a single family fire 26 items on shelves in basement preparedness starts with an individual s everyday life and involves items and training that would be useful in an emergency what is useful in an emergency is often also useful in everyday life 27 from personal preparedness preparedness continues on a continuum through family preparedness community preparedness and then business non-profit and governmental preparedness some organizations blend these various levels for example the international red cross and red crescent movement has a webpage on disaster training 28 as well as offering training on basic preparedness such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation and first aid other non-profits such as team rubicon bring specific groups of people into disaster preparedness and response operations 29 fema breaks down preparedness into a pyramid with citizens on the foundational bottom on top of which rests local government state government and federal government in that order 30 non-perishable food in cabinet the basic theme behind preparedness is to be ready for an emergency and there are a number of different variations of being ready based on an assessment of what sort of threats exist nonetheless there is basic guidance for preparedness that is common despite an area s specific dangers fema recommends that everyone have a three-day survival kit for their household 31 because individual household sizes and specific needs might vary fema s recommendations are not item specific but the list includes three-day supply of non-perishable food three-day supply of water – one gallon of water per person per day portable battery-powered radio or television and extra batteries flashlight and extra batteries first aid kit and manual sanitation and hygiene items e.g toilet paper menstrual hygiene products  matches and waterproof container whistle extra clothing kitchen accessories and cooking utensils including a can opener photocopies of credit and identification cards cash and coins special needs items such as prescription medications eyeglasses contact lens solutions and hearing aid batteries items for infants such as formula diapers bottles and pacifiers other items to meet unique family needs along similar lines but not exactly the same cdc has its own list for a proper disaster supply kit 32 water—one gallon per person per day food—nonperishable easy-to-prepare items flashlight battery powered or hand crank radio noaa weather radio if possible extra batteries first aid kit medications 7-day supply  other medical supplies and medical paperwork e.g. medication list and pertinent medical information multipurpose tool e.g. swiss army knife sanitation and personal hygiene items copies of personal documents e.g. proof of address deed lease to home passports birth certificates and insurance policies cell phone with chargers family and emergency contact information extra cash emergency blanket map s of the area extra set of car keys and house keys manual can opener children are a special population when considering emergency preparedness and many resources are directly focused on supporting them samhsa has list of tips for talking to children during infectious disease outbreaks to include being a good listener encouraging children to ask questions and modeling self-care by setting routines eating healthy meals getting enough sleep and taking deep breaths to handle stress 33 fema has similar advice noting that disasters can leave children feeling frightened confused and insecure whether a child has experienced it first hand had it happen to a friend or simply saw it on television 34 in the same publication fema further notes preparing for disaster helps everyone in the family accept the fact that disasters do happen and provides an opportunity to identify and collect the resources needed to meet basic needs after disaster preparation helps when people feel prepared they cope better and so do children to help people assess what threats might be in order to augment their emergency supplies or improve their disaster response skills fema has published a booklet called the threat and hazard identification and risk assessment guide 35 thira this guide which outlines the thira process emphasizes whole community involvement not just governmental agencies in preparedness efforts in this guide fema breaks down hazards into three categories natural technological and human caused and notes that each hazard should be assessed for both its likelihood and its significance according to fema communities should consider only those threats and hazards that could plausibly occur and communities should consider only those threats and hazards that would have a significant effect on them to develop threat and hazard context descriptions communities should take into account the time place and conditions in which threats or hazards might occur not all preparedness efforts and discussions involve the government or established ngos like the red cross emergency preparation discussions are active on the internet with many blogs and websites dedicated to discussing various aspects of preparedness on-line sales of items such as survival food medical supplies and heirloom seeds allow people to stock basements with cases of food and drinks with 25 year shelf lives sophisticated medical kits and seeds that are guaranteed to sprout even after years of storage 36 one group of people who put a lot of effort in disaster preparations is called doomsday preppers this subset of preparedness-minded people often share a belief that the fema or red cross emergency preparation suggestions and training are not extensive enough sometimes called survivalists doomsday preppers are often preparing for the end of the world as we know it abbreviated as teotwawki with a motto some have that the future belongs to those who prepare this preparedness subset has its own set of murphy s rules 37 including rule number 1 food you still don t have enough and rule number 26 people who thought the government would save them found out that it didn t not all emergency preparation efforts revolve around food guns and shelters though these items help address the needs in the bottom two sections of maslow s hierarchy of needs the american preppers network 38 has an extensive list of items that might be useful in less apparent ways than a first aid kid or help add fun to challenging times these items include books and magazines arts and crafts painting children s entertainment crayons and coloring books notebooks and writing supplies nuts bolts screws nails etc religious material sporting equipment card games and board games posters and banners creating awareness emergency preparedness goes beyond immediate family members for many people pets are an integral part of their families and emergency preparation advice includes them as well it is not unknown for pet owners to die while trying to rescue their pets from a fire or from drowning 39 cdc s disaster supply checklist for pets includes 32 food and water for at least 3 days for each pet bowls and a manual can opener depending on the pet you may need a litter box paper towels plastic trash bags grooming items and or household bleach medications and medical records stored in a waterproof container first aid kit with a pet first aid book sturdy leash harness and carrier to transport pet safely a carrier should be large enough for the animal to stand comfortably turn around and lie down your pet may have to stay in the carrier for several hours pet toys and the pet s bed if you can easily take it to reduce stress current photos and descriptions of your pets to help others identify them in case you and your pets become separated and to prove that they are yours information on feeding schedules medical conditions behavior problems and the name and telephone number of your veterinarian in case you have to board your pets or place them in foster care emergency preparedness also includes more than physical items and skill-specific training psychological preparedness is also a type of emergency preparedness and specific mental health preparedness resources are offered for mental health professionals by organizations such as the red cross 26 these mental health preparedness resources are designed to support both community members affected by a disaster and the disaster workers serving them cdc has a website devoted to coping with a disaster or traumatic event 40 after such an event the cdc through the substance abuse and mental health services administration samhsa  suggests that people seek psychological help when they exhibit symptoms such as excessive worry crying frequently an increase in irritability anger and frequent arguing wanting to be alone most of the time feeling anxious or fearful overwhelmed by sadness confused having trouble thinking clearly and concentrating and difficulty making decisions increased alcohol and or substance use increased physical aches pains complaints such as headaches and trouble with nerves sometimes emergency supplies are kept in what is called a bug-out bag while fema does not actually use the term bug out bag calling it instead some variation of a go kit the idea of having emergency items in a quickly accessible place is common to both fema and cdc though on-line discussions of what items a bug out bag should include sometimes cover items such as firearms and great knives that are not specifically suggested by fema or cdc 41 the theory behind a bug out bag is that emergency preparations should include the possibility of emergency evacuation whether fleeing a burning building or hastily packing a car to escape an impending hurricane flood or dangerous chemical release rapid departure from a home or workplace environment is always a possibility and fema suggests having a family emergency plan for such occasions 42 because family members may not be together when disaster strikes this plan should include reliable contact information for friends or relatives who live outside of what would be the disaster area for household members to notify they are safe or otherwise communicate with each other along with the contact information fema suggests having well-understood local gathering points if a house must be evacuated quickly to avoid the dangers of re-reentering a burning home 43 family and emergency contact information should be printed on cards and put in each family member s backpack or wallet if family members spend a significant amount of time in a specific location such as at work or school fema suggests learning the emergency preparation plans for those places 42 fema has a specific form in english and in spanish to help people put together these emergency plans though it lacks lines for email contact information 42 like children people with disabilities and other special needs have special emergency preparation needs while disability has a specific meaning for specific organizations such as collecting social security benefits 44 for the purposes of emergency preparedness the red cross uses the term in a broader sense to include people with physical medical sensor or cognitive disabilities or the elderly and other special needs populations 45 depending on the particular disability specific emergency preparations might be required fema s suggestions for people with disabilities includes having copies of prescriptions charging devices for medical devices such as motorized wheel chairs and a week s supply of medication readily available link or in a go stay kit 46 in some instances lack of competency in english may lead to special preparation requirements and communication efforts for both individuals and responders 47 fema notes that long term power outages can cause damage beyond the original disaster that can be mitigated with emergency generators or other power sources to provide an emergency power system 48 the united states department of energy states that homeowners business owners and local leaders may have to take an active role in dealing with energy disruptions on their own 49 this active role may include installing or other procuring generators that are either portable or permanently mounted and run on fuels such as propane or natural gas 50 or gasoline 51 concerns about carbon monoxide poisoning electrocution flooding fuel storage and fire lead even small property owners to consider professional installation and maintenance 48 major institutions like hospitals military bases and educational institutions often have or are considering extensive backup power systems 52 instead of or in addition to fuel-based power systems solar wind and other alternative power sources may be used 53 standalone batteries large or small are also used to provide backup charging for electrical systems and devices ranging from emergency lights to computers to cell phones 54 emergency preparedness does not stop at home or at school 55 the united states department of health and human services addresses specific emergency preparedness issues hospitals may have to respond to including maintaining a safe temperature providing adequate electricity for life support systems and even carrying out evacuations under extreme circumstances 56 fema encourages all businesses to have businesses to have an emergency response plan 57 and the small business administration specifically advises small business owners to also focus emergency preparedness and provides a variety of different worksheets and resources 58 fema cautions that emergencies happen while people are travelling as well 59 and provides guidance around emergency preparedness for a range travelers to include commuters 60 commuter emergency plan and holiday travelers 61 in particular ready.gov has a number of emergency preparations specifically designed for people with cars 62 these preparations include having a full gas tank maintaining adequate windshield wiper fluid and other basic car maintenance tips items specific to an emergency include jumper cables might want to include flares or reflective triangle flashlights to include extra batteries batteries have less power in colder weather first aid kit to include any necessary medications baby formula and diapers if caring for small children non-perishable food such as canned food be alert to liquids freezing in colder weather  and protein rich foods like nuts and energy bars manual can opener at least 1 gallon of water per person a day for at least 3 days be alert to hazards of frozen water and resultant container rupture basic toolkit pliers wrench screwdriver pet supplies food and water radio battery or hand cranked for snowy areas cat litter or sand for better tire traction shovel ice scraper warm clothes gloves hat sturdy boots jacket and an extra change of clothes blankets or sleeping bags charged cell phone and car charger in addition to emergency supplies and training for various situations fema offers advice on how to mitigate disasters the agency gives instructions on how to retrofit a home to minimize hazards from a flood to include installing a backflow prevention device anchoring fuel tanks and relocating electrical panels 63 marked gas shuttoff given the explosive danger posed by natural gas leaks ready.gov states unequivocally that it is vital that all household members know how to shut off natural gas and that property owners must ensure they have any special tools needed for their particular gas hookups ready.gov also notes that it is wise to teach all responsible household members where and how to shut off the electricity cautioning that individual circuits should be shut off before the main circuit ready.gov further states that it is vital that all household members learn how to shut off the water at the main house valve and cautions that the possibility that rusty valves might require replacement 64 response edit main article disaster response the response phase of an emergency may commence with search and rescue but in all cases the focus will quickly turn to fulfilling the basic humanitarian needs of the affected population this assistance may be provided by national or international agencies and organizations effective coordination of disaster assistance is often crucial particularly when many organizations respond and local emergency management agency lema capacity has been exceeded by the demand or diminished by the disaster itself the national response framework is a united states government publication that explains responsibilities and expectations of government officials at the local state federal and tribal levels it provides guidance on emergency support functions that may be integrated in whole or parts to aid in the response and recovery process on a personal level the response can take the shape either of a shelter in place or an evacuation evacuation sign in a shelter-in-place scenario a family would be prepared to fend for themselves in their home for many days without any form of outside support in an evacuation a family leaves the area by automobile or other mode of transportation taking with them the maximum amount of supplies they can carry possibly including a tent for shelter if mechanical transportation is not available evacuation on foot would ideally include carrying at least three days of supplies and rain-tight bedding a tarpaulin and a bedroll of blankets donations are often sought during this period especially for large disasters that overwhelm local capacity due to efficiencies of scale money is often the most cost-effective donation if fraud is avoided money is also the most flexible and if goods are sourced locally then transportation is minimized and the local economy is boosted some donors prefer to send gifts in kind however these items can end up creating issues rather than helping one innovation by occupy sandy volunteers is to use a donation registry where families and businesses impacted by the disaster can make specific requests which remote donors can purchase directly via a web site medical considerations will vary greatly based on the type of disaster and secondary effects survivors may sustain a multitude of injuries to include lacerations burns near drowning or crush syndrome recovery edit the recovery phase starts after the immediate threat to human life has subsided the immediate goal of the recovery phase is to bring the affected area back to normalcy as quickly as possible during reconstruction it is recommended to consider the location or construction material of the property the most extreme home confinement scenarios include war famine and severe epidemics and may last a year or more then recovery will take place inside the home planners for these events usually buy bulk foods and appropriate storage and preparation equipment and eat the food as part of normal life a simple balanced diet can be constructed from vitamin pills whole-meal wheat beans dried milk corn and cooking oil 65 vegetables fruits spices and meats both prepared and

coming from a variety of backgrounds other than the military or first responder fields educational opportunities are increasing for those seeking undergraduate and graduate degrees in emergency management or a related field there are over 180 schools in the us with emergency management-related programs but only one doctoral program specifically in emergency management 66 professional

managers principles edit in 2007, dr wayne blanchard of fema s emergency management higher education project at the direction of dr cortez lawrence superintendent of fema s emergency management institute convened a working group of emergency management practitioners and academics to consider principles of emergency management this was the first time the principles of the discipline were to be codified the group agreed on eight principles that will be used to guide the development of a doctrine of emergency management below is a summary comprehensive – consider and take into account all hazards all phases all stakeholders and all impacts relevant to disasters progressive – anticipate future disasters and take preventive and preparatory measures to build disaster-resistant and disaster-resilient communities risk-driven – use sound risk management principles hazard identification risk analysis and impact analysis in assigning priorities and resources integrated – ensure unity of effort among all levels of government and all elements of a community collaborative – create and sustain broad and sincere relationships among individuals and organizations to encourage trust advocate a team atmosphere build consensus and facilitate communication coordinated – synchronize the activities of all relevant stakeholders to achieve a common purpose flexible – use creative and innovative approaches in solving disaster challenges professional – value a science and knowledge-based approach based on education training experience ethical practice public stewardship and continuous improvement a fuller description of these principles can be found at 68 tools edit in recent years the continuity feature of emergency management has resulted in a new concept emergency

mitigation strategies such as the installation of sprinklers within the institution 71 professional associations hold regular workshops to keep individuals up to date with tools and resources in order to minimize risk and maximize recovery other tools edit in 2008, the u.s agency for international development created a web-based tool for estimating populations impacted by disasters called population explorer 72 the tool uses land scan population data developed by oak ridge national laboratory to distribute population at a resolution 1 km2 for all countries in the world used by usaid s fews net project to estimate populations vulnerable and or imd by food insecurity population explorer is gaining wide use in a range of emergency analysis and response actions including estimating populations impacted by floods in central america and the pacific ocean tsunami event in 2009. in 2007, a checklist for veterinarians was published in the journal of the american veterinary medical

united states has utilized the functional all-hazards approach for over 20 years in which managers develop processes such as communication warning or sheltering rather than developing single-hazard or threat focused plans e.g. a tornado plan  processes are then mapped to specific hazards or threats with the manager looking for gaps overlaps and conflicts between processes given these notions emergency managers must identify contemplate and assess possible man-made threats and natural threats that may affect their respective locales 111 because of geographical differences throughout the nation a variety of different threats affect communities among the states thus although similarities may exist no two emergency plans will be completely identical additionally each locale has different resources and capacities e.g. budgets personnel equipment etc for dealing with emergencies 112 each individual community must craft its own unique emergency plan that addresses potential threats that are specific to the locality 113 this creates a plan more resilient to unique events because all common processes are defined and it encourages planning done by the stakeholders who are closer to the individual processes such as a traffic management plan written by a public works director this type of planning can lead to conflict with non-emergency management regulatory bodies which require the development of hazard threat specific plans such as the development of specific h1n1 flu plans and terrorism-specific plans in the united states all disasters are initially local with

used for prioritization of hazard risks the smaug model provides an effective means of prioritizing hazard risks based upon the aforementioned criteria in order to address the risks posed by the hazards to the avail of effecting effective mitigation reduction response and recovery methods 123 seriousness can be defined as the relative impact in terms of people and dollars this includes the potential for lives to be lost and potential for injury as well as the physical social and as mentioned economic losses that may be incurred manageability can be defined as the relative ability to mitigate or reduce the hazard through managing the hazard or the community or both  hazards presenting a high risk and as such requiring significant amounts of risk reduction initiatives will be rated high 123 acceptability - the degree to which the risk of hazard is acceptable in terms of political environmental social and economic impact urgency - this is related to the probability of risk of hazard and is defined in terms of how imperative it is to address the hazard 123 growth - this is the potential for the hazard or event to expand or increase in either probability or risk to community or both should vulnerability increase potential for growth may also increase an example of the numerical ratings for each of the four criteria is shown below 124 manageability high 7 medium 5–7 low 0–4 urgency high 20yr medium 20yr low 100yrs acceptability high priority - poses more significant risk low priority - lower risk of hazard impact growth high 3 medium 2 low 1 seriousness high 4-5 medium 2-3 low 0-1
