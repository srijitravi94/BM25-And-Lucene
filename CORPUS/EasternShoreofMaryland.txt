chesapeake bay delaware bay watershed divide had been taken as the borderline delaware would be about half its current size finally although this has received less attention than other parts of eastern shore culture commercial east-west ties between delaware towns and maryland towns were culturally significant in colonial and early american periods despite the border line which largely cut through woods and swamps  trade with philadelphia was conducted by overland routes to delaware towns like odessa then called cantwell s bridge and smyrna then called duck creek  agricultural products and milled grain were taken up the delaware river by shallop men in small vessels called shallops these cultural connections continue to this day ocean city is a modern resort on what was once called
