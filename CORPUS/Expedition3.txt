hundreds per minute going beneath us really spectacular news reports had warned sky watchers in advance on 18 november 2001, earth was due to plow through a minefield of debris shed by comet

millions of people saw the show but only three of them—the ones on board the space station—saw it from above we had to look down to see the meteors says culbertson that s because the atmosphere where comet dust burns up is below the station an international crew of three were the third crew to live aboard the international space station the team was led by american commander frank culbertson and joined by russian crewmates vladimir dezhurov mission pilot and flight engineer mikhail tyurin as a part of the sts-105 mission discovery delivered the expedition 3 crew to the station during their
