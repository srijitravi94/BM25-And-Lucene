subsequent flag of florida grenadiers led by bernardo de gálvez at the siege of pensacola augusto ferrer-dalmau 2015. florida was the first part of the continental united states to be visited and settled by europeans the earliest known european explorers came with the spanish conquistador juan ponce de león ponce de león spotted and landed on the peninsula on april 2, 1513. he named the region la florida land of flowers  12 the story that he was searching for the fountain of youth is mythical and only appeared long after his death 13 in may 1539, conquistador hernando de soto skirted the coast of florida searching for a deep harbor to land he described seeing a thick wall of red mangroves spread mile after mile some reaching as high as 70 feet 21 m  with intertwined and elevated roots making landing difficult 14 the spanish introduced christianity cattle horses sheep the castilian language and more to florida 15 full citation needed spain established several settlements in florida with varying degrees of success in 1559, don tristán de luna y arellano established a settlement at present-day pensacola making it the first attempted settlement in florida but it was mostly abandoned by 1561. in 1565, the settlement of st augustine san agustín was established under the leadership of admiral and governor pedro menéndez de avilés creating what would become the oldest european settlement in the continental u.s and establishing the first generation of floridanos and the government of florida 16 spain maintained tenuous control over the region by converting the local tribes to christianity the geographical area of florida diminished with the establishment of english settlements to the north and french claims to the west the english attacked st augustine burning the city and its cathedral to the ground several times spain built the castillo de san marcos in 1672 and fort matanzas in 1742 to defend florida s capital city from attacks and to maintain its strategic position in the defense of the captaincy general of cuba and the spanish west indies florida attracted numerous africans and african-americans from adjacent british colonies who sought freedom from slavery in 1738, governor manuel de montiano established fort gracia real de santa teresa de mose near st augustine a fortified town for escaped slaves to whom montiano granted citizenship and freedom in return for their service in the florida militia and which became the first free black settlement legally sanctioned in north america 17 18 in 1763, spain traded florida to the kingdom of great britain for control of havana cuba which had been captured by the british during the seven years war it was part of a large expansion of british territory following their victory in the seven years war a large portion of the floridano population left taking along most of the remaining indigenous population to cuba 19 the british soon constructed the king s road connecting st augustine to georgia the road crossed the st johns river at a narrow point which the seminole called wacca pilatka and the british named cow ford  both names ostensibly reflecting the fact that cattle were brought across the river there 20 21 22 the british divided and consolidated the florida provinces las floridas into east florida and west florida a division the spanish government kept after the brief british period 23 the british government gave land grants to officers and soldiers who had fought in the french and indian war in order to encourage settlement in order to induce settlers to move to florida reports of its natural wealth were published in england a large number of british settlers who were described as being energetic and of good character moved to florida mostly coming from south carolina georgia and england there was also a group of settlers who came from the colony of bermuda this would be the first permanent english-speaking population in what is now duval county baker county st johns county and nassau county the british built good public roads and introduced the cultivation of sugar cane indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber 24 25 as a result of these initiatives northeastern florida prospered economically in a way it never did under spanish administration furthermore the british governors were directed to call general assemblies as soon as possible in order to make laws for the floridas and in the meantime they were with the advice of councils to establish courts this would be the first introduction of much of the english-derived legal system which florida still has today including trial by jury habeas corpus and county-based government 24 25 neither east florida nor west florida would send any representatives to philadelphia to draft the declaration of independence florida would remain a loyalist stronghold for the duration of the american revolution 26 spain regained both east and west florida after britain s defeat in the american revolution and the subsequent treaty of versailles in 1783, and continued the provincial divisions until 1821. joining the united states indian removal see also republic of east florida florida territory and seminole wars defense of florida s northern border with the united states was minor during the second spanish period the region became a haven for escaped slaves and a base for indian attacks against u.s territories and the u.s pressed spain for reform americans of english descent and americans of scots-irish descent began moving into northern florida from the backwoods of georgia and south carolina though technically not allowed by the spanish authorities and the floridan government they were never able to effectively police the border region and the backwoods settlers from the united states would continue to immigrate into florida unchecked these migrants mixing with the already present british settlers who had remained in florida since the british period would be the progenitors of the population known as florida crackers 27 these american settlers established a permanent foothold in the area and ignored spanish authorities the british settlers who had remained also resented spanish rule leading to a rebellion in 1810 and the establishment for ninety days of the so-called free and independent republic of west florida on september 23. after meetings beginning in june rebels overcame the garrison at baton rouge now in louisiana  and unfurled the flag of the new republic a single white star on a blue field this flag would later become known as the bonnie blue flag  in 1810, parts of west florida were annexed by proclamation of president james madison who claimed the region as part of the louisiana purchase these parts were incorporated into the newly formed territory of orleans the u.s annexed the mobile district of west florida to the mississippi territory in 1812. spain continued to dispute the area though the united states gradually increased the area it occupied in 1812, a group of settlers from georgia with de facto support from the u.s federal government attempted to overthrow the floridan government in the province of east florida the settlers hoped to convince floridans to join their cause and proclaim independence from spain but the settlers lost their tenuous support from the federal government and abandoned their cause by 1813. 28 seminoles based in east florida began raiding georgia settlements and offering havens for runaway slaves the united states army led increasingly frequent incursions into spanish territory including the 1817–1818 campaign against the seminole indians by andrew jackson that became known as the first seminole war the united states now effectively controlled east florida control was necessary according to secretary of state john quincy adams because florida had become a derelict open to the occupancy of every enemy civilized or savage of the united states and serving no other earthly purpose than as a post of annoyance to them 29 florida had become a burden to spain which could not afford to send settlers or garrisons madrid therefore decided to cede the territory to the united states through the adams-onís treaty which took effect in 1821. 30 president james monroe was authorized on march 3, 1821 to take possession of east florida and west florida for the united states and provide for initial governance 31 andrew jackson on behalf of the u.s federal government served as a military commissioner with the powers of governor of the newly acquired territory for a brief period 32 on march 30, 1822, the u.s congress merged east florida and part of west florida into the florida territory 33 a contemporaneous depiction of the new river massacre in 1836. by the early 1800s indian removal was a significant issue throughout the southeastern u.s and also in florida in 1830, the u.s congress passed the indian removal act and as settlement increased pressure grew on the united states government to remove the indians from florida seminoles harbored runaway blacks known as the black seminoles and clashes between whites and indians grew with the influx of new settlers in 1832, the treaty of payne s landing promised to the seminoles lands west of the mississippi river if they agreed to leave florida many seminole left at this time some seminoles remained and the u.s army arrived in florida leading to the second seminole war 1835–1842  following the war approximately 3,000 seminole and 800 black seminole were removed to indian territory a few hundred seminole remained in florida in the everglades a cracker cowboy 19th century on march 3, 1845, florida became the 27th state to join the united states of america 34 the state was admitted as a slave state and ceased to be a sanctuary for runaway slaves initially its population grew slowly as european settlers continued to encroach on seminole lands and the united states intervened to move the remaining seminoles to the west the third seminole war 1855–58 resulted in the forced removal of most of the remaining seminoles although hundreds of seminole indians remained in the everglades 35 slavery war and disenfranchisement further information florida in the american civil war the battle of olustee during the american civil war 1864. american settlers began to establish cotton plantations in north florida which required numerous laborers which they supplied by buying slaves in the domestic market by 1860, florida had only 140,424 people of whom 44 were enslaved there were fewer than 1,000 free african americans before the american civil war 36 in january 1861, nearly all delegates in the florida legislature approved an ordinance of secession declaring florida to be a sovereign and independent nation —an apparent reassertion to the preamble in florida s constitution of 1838, in which florida agreed with congress to be a free and independent state although not directly related to the issue of slavery the ordinance declared florida s secession from the union allowing it to become one of the founding members of the confederate states a looser union of states the confederal union received little help from florida the 15,000 men it offered were generally sent elsewhere the largest engagements in the state were the battle of olustee on february 20, 1864, and the battle of natural bridge on march 6, 1865. both were confederate victories 37 the war ended in 1865. following the american civil war florida s congressional representation was restored on june 25, 1868, albeit forcefully after radical reconstruction and the installation of unelected government officials under the final authority of federal military commanders after the reconstruction period ended in 1876, white democrats regained power in the state legislature in 1885 they created a new constitution followed by statutes through 1889 that disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites

the civil war 38 the boll weevil devastated cotton crops forty thousand blacks roughly one-fifth of their 1900 population left the state in the great migration they left due to lynchings and racial violence and for better opportunities 39 disfranchisement for most african americans in the state persisted until the civil rights movement of the 1960s gained federal legislation in 1965 to enforce protection of their constitutional suffrage 20th-century growth historically florida s economy has been based primarily upon agricultural products such as cattle sugar cane citrus fruits tomatoes and strawberries economic prosperity in the 1920s stimulated tourism to florida and related development of hotels and resort communities combined with its sudden elevation in profile was the florida land boom of the 1920s which brought a brief period of intense land development devastating hurricanes in 1926 and 1928, followed by the great depression brought that period to a halt florida s economy did not fully recover until the military buildup for world war ii in 1939, florida was described as “still very largely an empty state 40 subsequently the growing availability of air conditioning the climate and a low cost of living made the state a haven migration from the rust belt and the northeast sharply increased florida s population after 1945. in recent decades more migrants have come for the jobs in a developing economy with a population of more than 18 million according to the 2010 census florida is the most populous state in the southeastern united states and the fourth-most
