discovered guam march 6, 1521 during his circumnavigation of the globe the original inhabitants of guam and the northern mariana islands were the chamorro people who are believed to be descendants of austronesian people originating from southeast asia as early as 2000 bc 13 16 the ancient chamorro society had four classes chamorri chiefs  matua upper class  achaot middle class  and mana chang lower class  13 20–21 the matua were located in the coastal villages which meant they had the best access to fishing grounds whereas the mana chang were located in the interior of the island matua and mana chang rarely communicated with each other and matua often used achaot as intermediaries there were also makåhna similar to shamans  skilled in healing and medicine belief in spirits of ancient chamorros called taotao mo na still persists as a remnant of pre-european culture their society was organized along matrilineal clans 13 21 latte stones are stone pillars that are found only in the mariana islands they are a recent development in pre-contact chamorro society the latte-stone was used as a foundation on which thatched huts were built 13 26 latte stones consist of a base shaped from limestone called the haligi and with a capstone or tåsa made either from a large brain coral or limestone placed on top 13 27–28 a possible source for these stones the rota latte stone quarry was discovered in 1925 on rota 13 28 magellan s travel to guam edit the first european to travel to guam was portuguese navigator ferdinand magellan sailing for the king of spain when he sighted the island on march 6, 1521, during his fleet s circumnavigation of the globe 13 41–42 when magellan arrived on guam he was greeted by hundreds of small outrigger canoes that appeared to be flying over the water due to their considerable speed these outrigger canoes were called proas and resulted in magellan naming guam islas de las velas latinas islands of the lateen sails  antonio pigafetta one of magellan s original 18 said that the name was island of sails  but he also writes that the inhabitants entered the ships and stole whatever they could lay their hands on  including the small boat that was fastened to the poop of the flagship 14 129 those people are poor but ingenious and very thievish on account of which we called those three islands islas de los ladrones islands of thieves  14 131 spanish colonization and the manila galleons edit despite magellan s visit guam was not officially claimed by spain until january 26, 1565, by general miguel lópez de legazpi 13 46 from 1565 to 1815, guam and the northern mariana islands the only spanish outpost in the pacific ocean east of the philippines was an important resting stop for the manila galleons a fleet that covered the pacific trade route between acapulco and manila 13 51 to protect these pacific fleets spain built several defensive structures that still stand today such as fort nuestra señora de la soledad in umatac guam is the

cathedral dulce nombre de maria was formally opened on february 2, 1669, as was the royal college of san juan de letran 13 68 guam along with the rest of the mariana and caroline islands were treated as part of spain s colony in the philippines while the island s chamorro culture has indigenous roots the cultures of both guam and the northern marianas have many similarities with spanish culture due to three centuries of spanish rule 5 internal conflicts edit intermittent warfare lasting from july 23, 1670, until july 1695, plus the typhoons of 1671 and 1693, and in particular the smallpox epidemic of 1688, reduced the chamorro population from 50,000 to 10,000 to less than 5,000. 13 86 precipitated by the death of quipuha and the murder of father san vitores and pedro calungsod by local rebel chief matapang tensions led to a number of conflicts captain juan de santiago started a campaign to conquer the island which was continued by the successive commanders of the spanish forces 13 68–74 after his arrival in 1674, captain damian de esplana ordered the arrest of rebels who attacked the population of certain towns hostilities eventually led to the destruction of villages such as chochogo pepura tumon sidia-aty sagua nagan and ninca 13 74–75 starting in june 1676, the first spanish governor of guam capt francisco de irrisarri y vinar controlled internal affairs more strictly than his predecessors in order to curb tensions he also ordered the construction of schools roads and other infrastructure 13 75–76 later capt jose de quiroga arrived in 1680 and continued some of the development projects started by his predecessors he also continued the search for the rebels who had assassinated father san vitores resulting in campaigns against the rebels which were hiding out in some islands eventually leading to the death of matapang hurao and aguarin 13 77–78 quiroga brought some natives from the northern islands to guam ordering the population to live in a few large villages 13 78–79 these included jinapsan umatac pago agat and inarajan where he built a number of churches 13 79 by july 1695, quiroga had completed the conquest of guam rota tinian and aguigan 13 85 expulsion of the jesuits edit on february 26, 1767, charles iii of spain issued a decree confiscating the property of the jesuits and banishing them from spain and her possessions 13 101 as a

pacific phase in the second world war battle of guam july 1944 the northern mariana islands had become a league of nations mandate assigned to japan in 1919, pursuant to the treaty of versailles of 1919. it was the chamorros indigenous island people from the northern marianas who were brought to guam to serve as interpreters and in other capacities for the occupying japanese force the guamanian chamorros were treated as an occupied enemy by the japanese military after the war this would cause resentment between the guamanian chamorros and the chamorros of the northern marianas guam s chamorros believed their northern brethren should have been compassionate towards them whereas having been administered by japan for over 30 years the northern mariana chamorros were loyal to the japanese government the japanese occupation of guam lasted for approximately thirty-one months during this period the indigenous people of guam were subjected to forced labor family separation

post-european-contact chamorro guamanian culture is a combination of american spanish filipino other micronesian islander and mexican traditions few indigenous pre-hispanic customs remained following

colonial rule 1668–1898 the majority of the population was converted to roman catholicism and religious festivities such as easter and christmas became widespread post-contact chamorro cuisine is largely based on corn and includes tortillas tamales atole and chilaquiles which are a clear influence from mesoamerica principally mexico from spanish trade with asia the modern chamorro language has many historical parallels to modern philippine languages in that it is an austronesian language which has absorbed much spanish vocabulary it is a malayo-polynesian language along with such languages as tagalog indonesian hawaiian and even maori despite being spoken in the mid pacific ocean which is geographically closer to speakers of the polynesian islands chamorro is actually an outlier of the sunda–sulawesi languages subgroup chamorro is thus more closely related to and a part of the languages of the malay archipelago rather than its neighbours in polynesia among the languages of malay archipelago chamorro is most closely related to the languages in the south of the chain of islands within indonesia rather than the languages of the north in the philippines with which it shares linguistic spanish colonial influence also like filipinos many chamorros possess spanish surnames despite few of the inhabitants actually descending from the spanish colonisers spanish names and surnames were adopted after their conversion to roman catholic christianity in a phenomenon prompted by the imposition of the catálogo alfabético de apellidos in guam and other territories of the spanish east indies most notably the philippines due to foreign cultural influence from spain most aspects of the early indigenous culture have been lost though there has been a resurgence in preserving any remaining pre-hispanic culture in the last few decades some scholars have traveled throughout the pacific islands conducting research to study what the original chamorro cultural practices such as dance language and canoe building may have been like puntan dos amantes two lovers point  a national natural landmark 33 well known for its romantic associations two aspects of indigenous pre-hispanic culture that withstood time are chenchule and inafa maolek chenchule is the intricate system of reciprocity at the heart of chamorro society it is rooted in the core value of inafa maolek historian lawrence cunningham in 1992 wrote in a chamorro sense the land and its produce belong to everyone inafa maolek or interdependence is the key or central value in chamorro culture . inafa maolek depends on a spirit of cooperation and sharing this is the armature or core that everything in chamorro culture revolves around it is a powerful concern for mutuality rather than individualism and private property rights the core culture or pengngan chamorro is based on complex social protocol centered upon respect from sniffing over the hands of the elders called mangnginge in chamorro  the passing down of legends chants and courtship rituals to a person asking for permission from spiritual ancestors before entering a jungle or ancient battle grounds other practices predating spanish conquest include galaide canoe-making making of the belembaotuyan a string musical instrument made from a gourd  fashioning of åcho atupat slings and slingstones tool manufacture

tortoise shells and spondylus  the cosmopolitan and multicultural nature of modern guam poses challenges for chamorros struggling to preserve their culture and identity amidst forces of acculturation the increasing numbers of chamorros especially chamorro youth relocating to the u.s mainland has further complicated both definition and preservation of chamorro identity citation needed while only a few masters exist to continue traditional art forms the resurgence of interest among the chamorros to preserve the language and culture has resulted in a growing number of young chamorros who seek to continue the ancient ways of the chamorro people sports edit pacific games edit guam hosted the pacific games in 1975 and 1999. at the 2007 games guam finished 7th of 22 countries and 14th at the 2011

significant movement in favor of this u.s territory becoming a commonwealth which would give it a level of self-government similar to puerto rico and the northern mariana islands however the federal

irregularis was accidentally introduced to guam which previously had no native species of snake it nearly eliminated the native bird population the problem was exacerbated because the snake has no natural predators on the island the brown tree snake known locally as the kulebla is native to northern and eastern coasts of australia papua new guinea and the solomon islands it is slightly venomous but relatively harmless to human beings it is nocturnal although some studies have suggested a high density of these serpents on guam residents rarely see them the united states department of agriculture has trained detector dogs to keep the snakes out of the island s cargo flow the united states geological survey also has dogs that can detect snakes in forested environments around the region s islands 51 52 before the introduction of the brown tree snake guam was home to several endemic bird species among them were the guam rail or ko ko bird in chamorro and the guam flycatcher both common throughout the island today the flycatcher is entirely extinct and the guam rail is extinct in the wild but bred in captivity by the division of aquatic and wildlife resources the devastation caused by the snake has been significant over the past several decades as many as twelve bird species are believed to have been driven to extinction 53 according to many elders ko ko birds were common in guam before world war ii 54 other bird species threatened by the brown tree snake include the mariana crow the mariana swiftlet and the micronesian starling though populations are present on other islands including rota 53 guam is said to have many more insects and 40 times more spiders than neighboring islands because their natural predators birds are severely diminished and

residents 57 other introduced species include cane toads imported in 1937, the giant african snail an agricultural pest introduced during world war ii by japanese occupation troops and more recently frog species which could threaten crops in addition to providing additional food for the brown tree snake population reports of loud chirping frogs native to puerto rico and known as coquí that may have arrived from hawaii have led to fears that the noise could threaten guam s tourism 58 guam has no native amphibian species but now a total of eight amphibian species has been established in guam litoria fallax native to the eastern coast of australia has been present in guam since 1968, and rhinella marina the cane toad was brought to the island in 1937. the other 6 amphibian species namely hylarana guentheri native to mainland asia  microhyla pulchra native to mainland asia  polypedates braueri endemic to taiwan  eleutherodactylus planirostris native to the caribbean  fejervarya cancrivora the guam variety being most closely related to f cancrivora found in taiwan  and fejervarya limnocharis native to southeast asia  have been in guam since 2003. 59 many species were likely inadvertently introduced via shipping cargo especially from taiwan mainland china and southeast asia introduced feral pigs and deer over-hunting and habitat loss from human development are also major

leucaena leucocephala  much of guam s foliage was lost during world war ii in 1947, the u.s military is thought to have planted tangan-tangan by seeding the island from the air to prevent erosion

grow in many regularly burned areas grasslands and barrens have replaced previously forested areas leading to greater soil erosion during the rainy season sediment is carried by the heavy rains into the fena lake reservoir and ugum river leading to water quality problems for southern guam eroded silt also destroys the marine life in reefs around the island soil stabilization efforts by volunteers and forestry workers planting trees have had little success in preserving natural habitats 63 aquatic preserves edit having previously experienced extensive dredging tumon bay is now a marine wildlife preserve efforts have been made to protect guam s coral reef habitats from pollution eroded silt and overfishing problems that have led to decreased fish populations since guam is a significant vacation spot for scuba divers this is important in recent years the department of agriculture division of aquatic and wildlife resources has established several new marine preserves where fish populations are monitored by biologists 64 before adopting u.s environmental protection agency standards portions of tumon bay were dredged by the hotel chains to provide a better experience for hotel
