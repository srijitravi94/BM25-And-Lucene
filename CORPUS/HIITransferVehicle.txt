is an automated cargo spacecraft used to resupply the kibō japanese experiment module jem and the international space station iss  the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa has been working on the design since the early 1990s the first mission htv-1 was originally intended to be launched in 2001. it launched at 17 01 utc on 10 september 2009 on an h-iib launch vehicle 7 the name kounotori was chosen for the htv by jaxa because a white stork carries an image of conveying an important thing a baby happiness and other joyful things  therefore it precisely expresses the htv s mission to transport essential materials to the iss  8 design edit structure inside view of the pressurised logistics carrier section of htv-1 canadarm2 removing unpressurised payload from htv-2 the htv is about 9.8 m long including maneuvering thrusters at one end and 4.4 m in diameter total mass when empty is 10.5 tonnes 11.6 short tons  with a maximum total payload of 6,000 kilograms 13,000 lb 6.0 t 6.6 short tons  for a maximum launch weight of 16.5 tonnes 18.2 short tons  1 the htv is comparable in function to the russian progress european atv commercial dragon and commercial cygnus spacecraft all of which bring or are planned to bring supplies to the iss like the atv the htv carries more than twice the payload of the progress but is launched less than half as often unlike progress capsules and atvs which dock automatically htvs and american commercial spacecraft approach the iss in stages and are signaled by iss crew or ground control to continue from one holding point to the next once they reach their closest parking orbit to the iss crew grapple them using the robotic arm canadarm2 and berth them to an open berthing port on the harmony module 9 the htv has an external payload bay which is accessed by robotic arm after it has been berthed to the iss new payloads can be moved directly from the htv to kibō s exposed facility internally it has eight international standard payload racks isprs in total which can be unloaded by the crew in a shirt-sleeve environment after the retirement of nasa s space shuttle in 2011, htvs became the only spacecraft capable of transporting isprs to the iss the spacex dragon and orbital sciences cygnus can carry resupply cargo bags but not isprs citation needed the four main thrusters smaller attitude control thrusters can be seen at the right side of this view of htv-1 the intention of htv s modularized design was to use different module configuration to match the mission requirement 10 however to reduce the development cost it was decided to fly the mixed plc ulc configuration only 10 to control the htv s attitude and to perform the orbital maneuvers such as rendezvous and re-entry the craft has four 500 n class main thrusters and twenty-eight 110 n class attitude control thrusters both use bipropellant namely monomethylhydrazine mmh as fuel and mixed oxides of nitrogen mon3 as oxidizer 11 htv-1 -2, and -4 use aerojet s 110 n r-1e space shuttle s vernier engine and the 500 n based on the apollo spacecraft s r-4d 11 later htvs use 500 n class hbt-5 thrusters and 120 n class hbt-1 thrusters made by japanese manufacturer ihi aerospace co. ltd 12 the htv carries about 2400 kg of propellant in four tanks 11 after the unloading process is completed the htv will be loaded with waste and undocked the vehicle will then deorbit and be destroyed during reentry the debris falling into the pacific ocean 5 flights edit htv-2 departing tanegashima spaceport bound for the international space station initially seven missions were planned in 2008-2015 with the extension of iss project after 2015 through 2020, three more missions are planned possibly replacing the tenth flight with an improved cost-reduced version htv-x  13 the first vehicle was launched on an h-iib rocket a more powerful version of the earlier h-iia at 17 01 gmt on 10 september 2009, from launch pad 2 of the yoshinobu launch complex at the tanegashima space center 14 as of march 2015 update  five subsequent missions are planned—one each year for 2015–2019 15 —one fewer total mission than had been planned in august 2013 at the time the fourth htv mission

science and technology announced a proposal to replace htv with an improved cost-reduced version preliminary called htv-x 13 24 proposed concept of htv-x as of july 2015 update is 25 to re-use the design of htv s pressurized logistics carrier plc as much as possible except adding a side hatch for late access cargo to replace the unpressurized logistics carrier avionics module and propulsion module with a new service module instead of loading the unpressurized cargo inside the spacecraft load them on top of the service module re-using the plc design will allow minimizing the development cost and risk concentrating the reaction control system rcs and the solar panels to service module will allow simplifying the wiring and piping to reduce the weight and the manufacturing cost loading the unpressurized cargo outside the spacecraft allows larger cargo only limited by the launch vehicle fairing the aim is to cut the cost in half while keeping or extending the capability of existing htv 25 the simplification of overall structure will allow the launch mass of htv-x to be dropped to 15.5 t planned from htv s 16.5 t while the maximum weight of cargo will be increased to 7.2 t net weight 5.85 t excluding support structure weight from htv s 6.0 t net 4.0 t  26 in december 2015, the plan to develop htv-x was approved by the strategic headquarters for space policy of the cabinet office targeting fiscal year 2021 for the flight of htv-x1 technical demonstration vehicle to be launched by h3 rocket 27 26 with the agreement of japan-us open platform partnership program jp-us op3 in december 2015 to extend the cooperation of iss operation through 2024, japan will provide its share of iss operation costs with the form of transportation by htv-x and also a possibility to develop a small return capsule 28 former evolutionary proposals edit htv-r edit as of 2010 update  jaxa was planning to add a return capsule option in this concept htv s pressurized cargo would be replaced by a reentry module capable of returning 1.6 tonnes 1.8 tons cargo from iss to earth 29 30 needs update further conceptual plans in 2012 included a follow-on spacecraft design by 2022 which would accommodate a crew of three and carry up to 400 kilograms 880 lb of cargo 31 needs update lagrange outpost resupply edit as of 2014 update  both jaxa and mitsubishi conducted studies of a next generation htv as a possible japanese contribution to the proposed international manned outpost at earth-moon l2 32 33 this variant of htv was to be launched by h-x heavy and can carry 1.8 tons of supplies to eml2 32 modifications from the current htv includes the addition of solar electric paddles and extension of the propellant tank 32 manned variant edit a proposal announced in june 2008 suggested combining htv s propulsion module with a manned capsule for four people 34 japanese space station edit a japanese space station has been proposed to be built up from htv modules 35 this method is similar to how the modules in mir as well as many modules of the russian orbital segment of the iss are based on the tks cargo vehicle design citation needed gallery edit htv-3 near iss
