enriquillo-plantain garden fault system to the 18th caribbean geologic conference in march 2008, noting the large strain the team recommended high priority historical geologic rupture studies as the

politics of haiti voting in the 2006 elections in port-au-prince the government of haiti is a semi-presidential republic a multiparty system wherein the president of haiti is head of state elected

the national assembly of haiti the government is organized unitarily thus the central government delegates powers to the departments without a constitutional need for consent the current structure of

for the red cross  wherein icrc officer didier revol wrote such statistical estimations should be looked upon very skeptically because of the fact that the average haitian and haitian family has to and does spend a lot more than that daily the disconnect likely lies in the fact that these are estimates based on surveys conducted by asking individuals what their incomes are in the haitian culture it is very unlikely that one will receive a truthful and accurate answer to such a personal question for various reasons individuals will not tell the truth on such a private matter for some it is because it s none of your business  for others they will simply exaggerate their poor situation in hopes that some type of financial aide will be gained or rendered to them  141 the commune of cité soleil in port-au-prince has been called the most dangerous place on earth by the united nations it is one of the largest slums in the northern hemisphere 142 many of its residents are supporters of

national police hnp has been using innovative technologies to crack down on crime a notable bust in recent years when led to the dismantlement of the largest kidnapping ring in the country with the
