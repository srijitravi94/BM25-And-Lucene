hamilton ontario united empire loyalists in pre-colonial times the neutral indians used much of the land but were gradually driven out by the five later six nations iroquois who were allied with the british against the huron and their french allies a member of the iroquois confederacy provided the route and name for mohawk road which originally included king street in the lower city following the united states gaining independence after their american revolutionary war in 1784, about 10,000 united empire loyalists settled in upper canada what is now southern ontario  chiefly in niagara around the bay of quinte and along the st lawrence river between lake ontario and montreal the crown granted them land in these areas in order to develop upper canada and to compensate them for losses in the united states with former first nations lands available for purchase these new settlers were soon followed by many more americans attracted by the availability of inexpensive arable land at the same time large numbers of iroquois who had been allied with britain arrived from the united states and were settled on reserves west of lake ontario as compensation for lands they lost in what was now the united states 16 the town of hamilton was conceived by george hamilton a son of a queenston entrepreneur and founder robert hamilton  when he purchased farm holdings of james durand the local member of the british legislative assembly shortly after the war of 1812. 10 nathaniel hughson a property owner to the north cooperated with george hamilton to prepare a proposal for a courthouse and jail on hamilton s property hamilton offered the land to the crown for the future site durand was empowered by hughson and hamilton to sell property holdings which later became the site of the town as he had been instructed durand circulated the offers at york during a session of the legislative assembly which established a new gore district of which the hamilton townsite was a member 10 initially this town was not the most important centre of the gore district an early indication of hamilton’s sudden prosperity was signaled by the fact that in 1816 it was chosen over ancaster ontario that year to be the administrative center for the new gore district another dramatic economic turnabout for hamilton occurred in 1832 when a canal was finally cut through the outer sand bar that enabled hamilton to become a major port 17 a permanent jail was not constructed until 1832, when a cut-stone design was completed on prince s square one of the two squares created in 1816. 10 subsequently the first police board and the town limits were defined by statute on february 13, 1833. 18 official city status was achieved on june 9, 1846, by an act of parliament 9 victoria chapter 73. 4 by 1845, the population was 6,475. in 1846, there were useful roads to many communities as well as stage coaches and steamboats to toronto queenston and niagara eleven cargo schooners were owned in hamilton eleven churches were in operation a reading room provided access to newspapers from other cities and from england and the u.s in addition to stores of all types four banks tradesmen of various types and sixty-five taverns industry in the community included three breweries ten importers of dry goods and groceries five importers of hardware two tanneries three coachmakers and a marble and a stone works 19 as the city grew several prominent buildings were constructed in the late 19th century including the grand lodge of canada in 1855, 20 west flamboro methodist church in 1879 later purchased by dufferin masonic lodge in 1893  21 a public library in 1890, and the right house department store in 1893. the first commercial telephone service in canada the first telephone exchange in the british empire and the second telephone exchange in all of north america were each established in the city between 1877–78 22 the city had several interurban electric street railways and two inclines all powered by the cataract power co 23 scottish rite castle though suffering through the hamilton street railway strike of 1906, with industrial businesses expanding hamilton s population doubled between 1900 and 1914. two steel manufacturing companies stelco and dofasco were formed in 1910 and 1912, respectively procter gamble and the beech-nut packing company opened manufacturing plants in 1914 and 1922, respectively their first outside the us 24 population and economic growth continued until the 1960s in 1929 the city s first high-rise building the pigott building was constructed that year mcmaster university moved from toronto to hamilton in 1934 the second canadian tire store in canada opened here in 1940 the airport was completed and in 1948, the studebaker assembly line was constructed 25 infrastructure and retail development continued with the burlington bay james n allan skyway opening in 1958, and the first tim hortons store in 1964. since then many of the large industries have moved or shut down operations in restructuring that also affected the united states 24 the economy has shifted more toward the service sector such as transportation education and health services on january 1, 2001, the new city of hamilton was formed from the amalgamation of hamilton and its five neighbouring municipalities ancaster dundas flamborough glanbrook and stoney creek 11 before amalgamation the old city of hamilton had 331,121 hamiltonians divided into 100 neighbourhoods the former region of hamilton-wentworth had a population of 490,268. the amalgamation created a single-tier municipal government ending subsidization of its suburbs the new amalgamated city has 519,949 people in more than 100 neighbourhoods and surrounding communities 26 in 1997 there

hamilton is located in southern ontario on the western end of the niagara peninsula and wraps around the westernmost part of lake ontario most of the city including the downtown section is on the south shore hamilton is situated in the geographic centre of the golden horseshoe and is roughly the midway point between toronto and buffalo new york although slightly closer to the former its major physical features are hamilton harbour marking the northern limit of the city and the niagara escarpment running through the middle of the city across its entire breadth bisecting the city into upper and lower parts the maximum high point is 250m 820 above the level of lake ontario 29 according to all records from local historians this district was called attiwandaronia by the native neutral

places by quebec author mary soderstrom which examines the city as an example of an industrial powerhouse co-existing with nature 31 soderstrom credits thomas mcquesten and family in the 1930s who became champions of parks greenspace and roads in hamilton 32 hamilton harbour is a natural harbour with a large sandbar called the beachstrip this sandbar was deposited during a period of higher lake levels during the last ice age and extends southeast through the central lower city to the escarpment hamilton s deep sea port is accessed by ship canal through the beach strip into the harbour and is traversed by two bridges the qew s burlington bay james n allan skyway and the lower canal lift bridge 33 panoramic view of hamilton harbour from t.b mcquesten high level bridge on york boulevard near

john ryckman born in barton township where present day downtown hamilton is  described the area in 1803 as he remembered it the city in 1803 was all forest the shores of the bay were difficult to reach or see because they were hidden by a thick almost impenetrable mass of trees and undergrowth . bears ate pigs so settlers warred on bears wolves gobbled sheep and geese so they hunted and trapped wolves they also held organized raids on rattlesnakes on the mountainside there was plenty of game many a time have i seen sic a deer jump the fence into my back yard and there were millions of pigeons which we clubbed as they flew low 34 webster s falls at spencer gorge webster s falls conservation area albion falls george hamilton a settler and local politician established a town site in the northern portion of barton township in 1815. he kept several east–west roads which were originally indian trails but the north–south streets were on a regular grid pattern streets were designated east or west if they crossed james street or highway 6. streets were designated north or south if they crossed king street or highway 8. 35 the overall design of the townsite likely conceived in 1816, was commonplace george hamilton employed a grid street pattern used in most towns in upper canada and throughout the american frontier the eighty original lots had frontages of fifty feet each lot faced a broad street and backed onto a twelve-foot lane it took at least a decade for all of the original lots to be sold but the construction of the burlington canal in 1823, and a new court-house in 1827 encouraged hamilton to add more blocks around 1828–9 at this time he included a market square in an effort to draw commercial activity onto his lands but the natural growth of the town was to the north of hamilton s plot 36 the hamilton conservation authority owns leases or manages about 4,500 hectares 11,100 acres of land with the city operating 1,077 hectares 2,661 acres of parkland at 310 locations 37 38 many of the parks are located along the niagara escarpment which runs from tobermory at the tip of the bruce peninsula in the north to queenston at the niagara river in the south and provides views of the cities and towns at the western end of lake ontario the hiking path bruce trail runs the length of the escarpment 39 hamilton is home to more than 100 waterfalls and cascades most of which are on or near the bruce trail as it winds through the niagara escarpment 40 panoramic view of lower hamilton from sam lawrence park near concession street on the niagara escarpment hamilton mountain  climate edit hamilton s climate is humid-continental characterized by changeable weather patterns however its climate is moderate compared with most of canada hamilton s location on an embayment at the southwestern corner of lake ontario with an escarpment dividing upper and lower parts of the city results in noticeable disparities in weather over short distances this is also the case with pollution levels which depending on localized winds patterns or low clouds can be high in certain areas mostly originating from the city s steel industry mixed with regional vehicle pollution with a july average of exactly 22.0 °c 71.6 °f  41 the lower city is located in a pocket of the dfa climate zone found at the southwestern end of lake ontario between hamilton and toronto and eastward into the niagara peninsula  while the upper reaches of the city fall into the dfb climate zone the airport s open rural location and higher altitude 240m vs 85m asl downtown results in lower temperatures generally windier conditions and higher snowfall amounts than lower built-up areas of the city one exception is on early spring afternoons when colder than air lake temperatures keep shoreline areas significantly cooler under the presence of an east or north-east onshore flow the highest temperature ever recorded in hamilton was 41.1 °c 106 °f on 14 july
