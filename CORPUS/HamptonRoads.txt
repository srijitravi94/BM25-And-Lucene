roads is a centuries-old designation that originated when the region was a struggling english outpost nearly four hundred years ago the word hampton honors one of the founders of the virginia company of london and a great supporter of the colonization of virginia henry wriothesley 3rd earl of southampton the early administrative center of the new colony was known as elizabeth cittie named for princess elizabeth the daughter of king james i and formally designated by the virginia company in 1619. the town at the center of elizabeth cittie became known as hampton  and a nearby waterway was designated hampton creek also known as hampton river  other references to the earl include the area to the north across the bay in what is now the eastern shore which became known as northampton and an area south of the james river which became southampton as with hampton both of these names remain in use today the term roads short for roadstead indicates the safety of a port as applied to a body of water it is a partly sheltered area of water near a shore in which vessels may ride at anchor  8 examples of other roadsteads are castle roads in another of the virginia company s settlements bermuda and lahaina roads in hawaii in 1755, the virginia general assembly recorded the name hampton roads as the channel linking the james elizabeth and nansemond rivers with the chesapeake bay 1 hampton roads has become known as the world s largest natural harbor citation needed  in part because it is the northernmost major east coast port of the united states which is ice-free year round this status is claimed with the notable exception of the extraordinarily cold winter of 1917, which was the entire u.s s coldest year on record over time the entire region has come to be known as hampton roads  a label more specific than its other moniker tidewater virginia  which could by implication include other areas of tidal land in eastern virginia the u.s postal service changed the area s postmark from tidewater virginia to hampton roads virginia beginning in 1983. 1 definitions edit counties and independent cities edit the u.s census bureau defines the virginia beach–norfolk–newport

the library of virginia 17th–19th centuries edit the first colonists arrived in 1607 when english captain christopher newport landed at cape henry today s city of virginia beach an event now called the first landing however his party moved on in search of a more defensible area upriver mindful of competitors such as the spanish who had built a failed settlement on the virginia peninsula known as the ajacán mission after exploring the james river they established the first successful english colony in the new world on jamestown island on may 14, 1607. 19 but the low marshy site proved unhealthy and most of the colonists died before a new governor lord de la warr delaware arrived with john rolfe who would establish the virginia tobacco industry 19 the harbor and rivers of hampton roads were immediately recognised as prime locations for commerce shipbuilding and military installations with the fortifications at old point comfort established as early as 1610, and gosport navy yard later norfolk naval shipyard in 1767. the decisive battle of the revolution was won at yorktown in 1781, and the first naval action of the war of 1812 took place in hampton roads when a royal naval vessel was seized by the american privateer dash later the entrance from chesapeake bay was equipped with new fortifications fort monroe and fort wool  much of the building work being supervised by a young military engineer robert e lee during the american civil war 1861–1865  the historic battle of hampton roads between the first american ironclad warships the uss monitor and the css virginia took place off sewell s point in 1862. the battle was inconclusive but union forces later took control of hampton roads norfolk and the lower james river though they were thwarted from venturing further upstream by a strong confederate battery at drewry s bluff also in 1862, fort monroe was the launching place for union general george mcclellan s massive advance up the virginia peninsula which almost reached the confederate capital richmond before the seven days battles forced him back in 1865, as the confederacy was near collapse president abraham lincoln met with three senior confederates at hampton roads in an unsuccessful bid for a negotiated peace 20 some former slaves had been camped near fort monroe where they were declared to be contraband of war instead of being returned to their former owners booker t washington was among the freedmen who attended the local school which evolved into the present-day hampton university 20th century edit the jamestown exposition for the 300th anniversary of the 1607 founding of jamestown was held at sewell s point in a rural section of norfolk county in 1907. president theodore roosevelt arrived by water in the harbor of hampton roads as did other notable persons such as mark twain and henry huttleston rogers who both arrived aboard the latter s steam yacht kanawha a major naval display was featured and the u.s great white fleet made an appearance the leaders of the u.s navy apparently did not fail to note the ideal harbor conditions as was later proved beginning in 1917, as the united states became involved in world war i under president woodrow wilson formerly rural sewell s point became the site of what grew to become the largest naval base in the world which was established by the united states navy and is now known as the naval station norfolk twice in the 20th century inhabitants mostly african american were displaced when land along the northern side of the peninsula primarily in york county west of yorktown was taken in large tracts for military use during world war i and world war ii creating the present-day u.s naval weapons station yorktown which includes cheatham annex and a former seabee base which became camp peary communities including the reservation  halstead s point penniman bigler s mill and magruder were all lost and absorbed into the large military bases although some left the area entirely many of the displaced families chose to relocate nearby to grove an unincorporated town in southeastern james city county where many generations of some of those families now reside from a population estimated at only 37 in 1895, grove had grown to an estimated 1,100 families by the end of the 20th century to its north grove actually borders the naval weapons station property and on its extreme east a portion of the u.s army s land at fort eustis extends across skiffe s creek although there is no direct access to either base  colonial williamsburg edit main article colonial williamsburg it was the dream of an episcopal priest to save his 18th-century church building by turning williamsburg into the world s largest living museum wlliamsburg replaced jamestown at the very end of the 17th century after a disastrous fire it was the capital of the colony and the new state of virginia from 1699 to 1780. the capital was moved to richmond in 1780. williamsburg became a sleepy small town during the civil war the battle of williamsburg was fought nearby during the peninsula campaign in the spring months of 1862.. the decaying town was not located along any major waterway and did not have railroad access until 1881. perhaps due to the secure inland location originally known as middle plantation williamsburg missed growth and economic expansion in the 19th century the main economic engines were the college of william mary and eastern state hospital the college of william and mary was chartered by the crown and is the only pre-independence college to have kept it in addition to the city s historic past quite a few buildings of antiquity from the 18th century were still extant although time was taking a toll by the early 20th century the reverend dr w.a.r goodwin of bruton parish church motive was to only to save historic church building which was secured by 1907. he subsequently served in rochester new york for many years upon returning to williamsburg in 1923 he realized that many of the other colonial-era buildings were deteriorating and their existence was at risk goodwin dreamt of a much larger restoration of the colonial town a cleric of modest means he first sought support and financing from a number of sources before successfully drawing the interests before receiving major financial support from standard oil heir and philanthropist john d rockefeller jr and his wife abby aldrich rockefeller the result is the creation of colonial williamsburg with extensive restoration of buildings such as the wren building of the college of william mary and the governor s palace and the transformation of downtown williamsburg area into historic district of restored buildings many 19th century buildings were removed by the 1930s colonial williamsburg had become the centerpiece of the historic triangle of colonial virginia these were of course jamestown where the colony started williamsburg and yorktown where independence from great britain was won the three points were joined by the u.s national park service s colonial parkway a remarkable accomplishment in course of 27 years the historic triangle area of the hampton roads region became one of the largest tourist attractions in the entire world in dr goodwin s words williamsburg is jamestown continued and yorktown is williamsburg vindicated see

1634 and 1659 respectively the syms-eaton academy was later renamed hampton academy and in 1852 became part of the public school system thus hampton high school lays claim to being the oldest public school in the united states 21 the trust fund created from the syms and eaton donations has remained intact since the 17th century and was incorporated into support for the hampton public school system 22 in 1957, the hampton roads bridge–tunnel was the first bridge–tunnel complex in the world to be followed by the area s much longer chesapeake bay bridge–tunnel in 1963. this was followed by the monitor–merrimac memorial bridge–tunnel in 1992. the prevalence of bridge–tunnels in the area is due to the number of shipbuilding and naval bases in the area access to the open ocean from norfolk

from the earliest times the harbor was the key to the hampton roads area s growth both on land and in water-related activities and events ironically the harbor and its tributary waterways were and still are both important transportation conduits and obstacles to other land-based commerce and travel yet the community leaders learned to overcome them in modern times the region has faced increasing transportation challenges as it has become largely urbanized with additional traffic needs in the 21st century the conflicts between traffic on vital waterways and land-based travel continue to present the area s leaders with extraordinary transportation challenges both for additional capacity and as the existing infrastructure much of it originally built with toll revenues has aged without an adequate source of funding to repair or build replacements the now-closed kings highway bridge in suffolk and the jordan bridge closed by neighboring chesapeake in 2008 were each built in the 1920s these were considered locally prime examples of this situation 33 34 in 2007, the new hampton roads transportation authority hrta was formed under a controversial state law to levy
