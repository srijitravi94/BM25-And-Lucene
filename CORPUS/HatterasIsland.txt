were the first human inhabitants of hatteras island 2 they established a settlement village known as croatoan on the island 2 colonial era edit the story of the missing colony began when john white finally returned to roanoke on a fifth voyage to the colony a much-delayed re-supply mission arriving in 1590. at that time the settlement was found abandoned the only clue to the colonists whereabouts was the word croatoan found carved into the palisade of the fort it is logical that the colonists left on roanoke had gone back to croatoan as they had already lived there and had had a strong relationship with the natives some of whom had visited england 3 john white who made maps showing both croatoan and roanoke wrote in 1590 i greatly joyed that i had safely found a certain token of their safe being at croatoan which is the place where manteo was born and the savages of the island our friends sic 4 white had instructed them that if anything happened to them they should carve a maltese cross on a tree nearby indicating that their disappearance had been forced as there was no cross white took this to mean they had moved to croatoan island now known as hatteras island  upon finding the message of croatoan carved on the palisade white also wrote the next morning it was agreed by the captain and myself with the master and others to weigh anchor and go for the place at croatoan where our planters were for that then the wind was good for that place 5 however he was unable to conduct a search as a massive storm was brewing and his men refused to go any further the
