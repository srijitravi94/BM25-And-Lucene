america having received statehood on august 21, 1959. 10 hawaii is the only u.s state located in oceania and the only one composed entirely of islands it is the northernmost island group in polynesia occupying most of an archipelago in the central pacific ocean 11 hawaii is the only u.s state located outside north america the state encompasses nearly the entire volcanic hawaiian archipelago which comprises hundreds of islands spread over 1,500 miles 2,400 km  at the southeastern end of the archipelago the eight main islands are—in order from northwest to southeast niʻihau kauaʻi oʻahu molokaʻi lānaʻi kahoʻolawe maui and the island of hawaiʻi the last is the largest island in the group it is often called the big island or hawaiʻi island to avoid confusion with the state or archipelago the archipelago is physiographically and ethnologically part of the polynesian subregion of oceania hawaii s diverse natural scenery warm tropical climate abundance of public beaches oceanic surroundings and active volcanoes make it a popular destination for tourists surfers biologists and volcanologists because of its central location in the pacific and 19th-century labor migration hawaii s culture is strongly influenced by north american and asian cultures in addition to its indigenous hawaiian culture hawaii has over a million permanent residents along with many visitors and u.s military personnel its capital is honolulu on the island of oʻahu hawaii is the 8th-smallest and the 11th-least populous but the 13th-most densely populated of the fifty u.s states it is the only state with an asian plurality the state s coastline is about 750 miles 1,210 km long the fourth longest in the u.s after the coastlines of alaska florida and california etymology the state of hawaii derives its name from the name of its largest island hawaiʻi a common hawaiian explanation of the name of hawaiʻi is that was named for hawaiʻiloa a legendary figure from hawaiian myth he is said to have discovered the islands when they were first settled 12 13 the hawaiian language word hawaiʻi is very similar to proto-polynesian sawaiki with the reconstructed meaning homeland  14 cognates of hawaiʻi are found in other polynesian languages including māori hawaiki  rarotongan ʻavaiki and samoan savaiʻi  according to linguists pukui and elbert 15 e lsewhere in polynesia hawaiʻi or a cognate is the name of the underworld or of the ancestral home but in hawaii the name has no meaning  16 spelling of state name a somewhat divisive political issue arose in 1978 when the constitution of the state of hawaii added hawaiian as a second official state language 17 the title of the state constitution is the constitution of the state of hawaii article xv section 1 of the constitution uses the state of hawaii 18 diacritics were not used because the document drafted in 1949, 19 predates the use of the okina ʻ and the kahakō in modern hawaiian orthography the exact spelling of the state s name in the hawaiian language is hawaiʻi b in the hawaii admission act that granted hawaiian statehood the federal government recognized hawaii as the official state name official government publications department and office titles and the seal of hawaii use the traditional spelling with no symbols for glottal stops or vowel length 20 in contrast the national and state parks services the university of hawaiʻi and some private enterprises implement these symbols no precedent for changes to u.s state names exists since the adoption of the united states constitution in 1789. however the constitution of massachusetts formally changed the province of massachusetts bay to the commonwealth of massachusetts in 1780, and in 1819 the territory of arkansaw was created but was later admitted

about 33,500 feet 10,200 m  34 geology main article hawaii hotspot pāhoehoe or smooth lava spills into the pacific ocean forming new rock off the coast of the island of hawaii the hawaiian islands were formed by volcanic activity initiated at an undersea magma source called the hawaii hotspot the process is continuing to build islands the tectonic plate beneath much of the pacific ocean continually moves northwest and the hot spot remains stationary slowly creating new volcanoes because of the hotspot s location all currently active land volcanoes are located on the southern half of hawaii island the newest volcano lōʻihi seamount is located south of the coast of hawaii island the last volcanic eruption outside hawaii island occurred at haleakalā on maui before the late 18th century possibly hundreds of years earlier 35 in 1790, kīlauea exploded it was the deadliest eruption known to have occurred in the modern era in what is now the united states 36 up to 5,405 warriors and their families marching on kīlauea were killed by the eruption 37 volcanic activity and subsequent erosion have created impressive geological features hawaii island has the third-highest point among the world s islands 38 on the flanks of the volcanoes slope instability has generated damaging earthquakes and related tsunamis particularly in 1868 and 1975. 39 steep cliffs have been created by catastrophic debris avalanches on the submerged flanks of ocean island volcanoes 40 41 flora and fauna see also endemism in the hawaiian islands and list of invasive plant species in hawaii corvus hawaiiensis the endemic hawaiian crow ʻalalā  is extinct in the wild because the islands of hawaii are distant from other land habitats life is thought to have arrived there by wind waves i.e by ocean currents and wings i.e birds insects and any seeds they may have carried on their feathers  this isolation in combination with the diverse environment including extreme altitudes tropical climates and arid shorelines  produced an array of endemic flora and fauna hawaii has more endangered species and has lost a higher percentage of its endemic species than any other u.s state 42 one endemic plant brighamia now requires hand-pollination because its natural pollinator is presumed to be extinct 43 the two species of brighamia—b rockii and b insignis—are represented in the wild by around 120 individual plants to ensure these plants set seed biologists rappel down 3,000-foot 910 m cliffs to brush pollen onto their stigmas 44 the extant main islands of the archipelago have been above the surface of the ocean for fewer than 10 million years a fraction of the time biological colonization and evolution have occurred there the islands are well known for the environmental diversity that occurs on high mountains within a trade winds field on a single island the climate around the coasts can range from dry tropical less than 20 inches or 510 millimeters annual rainfall to wet tropical on the slopes environments range from tropical rainforest more than 200 inches or 5,100 millimeters per year  through a temperate climate to alpine conditions with a cold dry climate the rainy climate

states—apart from the original thirteen along with the vermont republic 1791  the republic of texas 1845  and the california republic 1846 —that were independent nations prior to statehood along with texas hawaii had formal international diplomatic recognition as a nation 50 the kingdom of hawaiʻi was sovereign from 1810 until 1893 when the monarchy was overthrown by resident american and european capitalists and landholders hawaii was an independent republic from 1894 until august 12, 1898, when it officially became a territory of the united states hawaii was admitted as a u.s state on august 21, 1959. 51 first human settlement – ancient hawaiʻi 800–1778 main article ancient hawaii based on archaeological evidence the earliest habitation of the hawaiian islands dates to around 300 ce probably by polynesian settlers from the marquesas islands a second wave of migration from raiatea and bora bora took place in the 11th century the date of the human discovery and habitation of the hawaiian islands is the subject of academic debate 52 some archaeologists and historians think it was a later wave of immigrants from tahiti around 1000 ce who introduced a new line of high chiefs the kapu system the practice of human sacrifice and the building of heiau citation needed this later immigration is detailed in hawaiian mythology moʻolelo about paʻao other authors say there is no archaeological or linguistic evidence for a later influx of tahitian settlers and that paʻao must be regarded as a myth citation needed the history of the islands is marked by a slow steady growth in population and the size of the chiefdoms which grew to encompass whole islands local chiefs called aliʻi ruled their settlements and launched wars to extend their influence and defend their communities from predatory rivals ancient hawaii was a caste-based society much like that of hindus in india 53 european arrival kalaniʻōpuʻu king of hawaiʻi brings presents to captain cook it is possible that spanish explorers arrived in the hawaiian islands in the 16th century—200 years before captain james cook s first documented visit in 1778. ruy lópez de villalobos commanded a fleet of six ships that left acapulco in 1542 bound for the philippines with a spanish sailor named juan gaetano aboard as pilot depending on the interpretation gaetano s reports describe an encounter with either hawaiʻi or the marshall islands 54 55 better source needed if de villalobos crew spotted hawaiʻi gaetano would be considered the first european to see the islands some scholars have dismissed these claims due to a lack of credibility 56 57 spanish archives contain a chart that depicts islands at the same latitude as hawaiʻi but with a longitude ten degrees east of the islands in this manuscript the island of maui is named la desgraciada the unfortunate island  and what appears to be hawaiʻi island is named la mesa the table  islands resembling kahoolawe lanai and molokai are named los monjes the monks  58 for two-and-a-half centuries spanish galleons crossed the pacific from mexico along a route that passed south of hawaiʻi on their way to manila the exact route was kept secret to protect the spanish trade monopoly against competing powers the 1778 arrival of british explorer james cook was the first documented contact by a european explorer with hawaii cook named the archipelago as the sandwich islands in honor of his sponsor john montagu 4th earl of sandwich cook published the islands location and rendered the native name as owyhee this spelling lives on in owyhee county idaho it was named after three native hawaiian members of a trapping party who went missing in that area the owyhee mountains were also named for them 59 king kamehameha receiving otto von kotzebue s russian naval expedition drawing by louis choris in 1816. cook visited the hawaiian islands twice as he prepared for departure after his second visit in 1779, a quarrel ensued as cook took temple idols and fencing as firewood  60 and a minor chief and his men took a ship s boat cook abducted the king of hawaiʻi island kalaniʻōpuʻu and held him for ransom aboard his ship in order to gain return of cook s boat this tactic had worked in tahiti and other islands 61 instead kalaniʻōpuʻu s supporters fought back killing cook and four marines as cook s party retreated along the beach to their ship they departed without the ship s boat after cook s visit and the publication of several books relating his voyages the hawaiian islands attracted many european visitors explorers traders and eventually whalers who found the islands to be a convenient harbor and source of supplies early british influence can be seen in the design of the flag of hawaiʻi which bears the union jack in the top-left corner these visitors introduced diseases to the once-isolated islands causing the hawaiian population to drop precipitously 62 native hawaiians had no resistance to eurasian diseases such as influenza smallpox and measles by 1820, disease famine and wars between the chiefs killed more than half of the native hawaiian population 63 during the 1850s measles killed a fifth of hawaii s people 64 historical records indicated the earliest chinese immigrants to hawaii originated from guangdong province a few sailors arrived in 1778 with captain cook s journey and more arrived in 1789 with an american trader who settled in hawaii in the late 18th century it appears that leprosy was introduced by chinese workers by 1830 as with the other new infectious diseases it proved damaging to the hawaiians citation needed kingdom of hawaiʻi main article kingdom of hawaii house of kamehameha kamehameha i conquered the hawaiian islands and established a unified monarchy across the archipelago during the 1780s and 1790s chiefs often fought for power after a series of battles that ended in 1795, all inhabited islands were subjugated under a single ruler who became known as king kamehameha the great he established the house of kamehameha a dynasty that ruled the kingdom until 1872. 65 after kamehameha ii inherited the throne in 1819, american protestant missionaries to hawaii converted many hawaiians to christianity they used their influence to end many traditional practices of the people 66 67 during the reign of king kamehameha iii hawai i turned into a christian monarchy with the signing of the 1840 constitution 68 hiram bingham i a prominent protestant missionary was a trusted adviser to the monarchy during this period other missionaries and their descendants became active in commercial and political affairs leading to conflicts between the monarchy and its restive american subjects 69 catholic and mormon missionaries were also active in the kingdom but they converted a minority of the native hawaiian population 70 71 72 missionaries from each major group administered to the leper colony at kalaupapa on molokaʻi which was established in 1866 and operated well into the 20th century the best known were father damien and mother marianne cope both of whom were canonized in the early 21st century as roman catholic saints the death of the bachelor king kamehameha v—who did not name an heir—resulted in the popular election of lunalilo over kalākaua lunalilo died the next year also without naming an heir in 1874, the election was contested within the legislature between kalākaua and emma queen consort of kamehameha iv after riots broke out the united states and britain landed troops on the islands to restore order king kalākaua was chosen as monarch by the legislative assembly by a vote of 39 to 6 on february 12, 1874. 73 1887 constitution and overthrow preparations in 1887, kalākaua was forced to sign the 1887 constitution of the kingdom of hawaii drafted by white businessmen and lawyers the document stripped the king of much of his authority it established a property qualification for voting that effectively disenfranchised most hawaiians and immigrant laborers and favored the wealthier white elite resident whites were allowed to vote but resident asians were not as the 1887 constitution was signed under threat of violence it is known as the bayonet constitution king kalākaua reduced to a figurehead reigned until his death in 1891. his sister queen liliʻuokalani succeeded him she was the last monarch of hawaiʻi 74 in 1893, queen

in the united states are manufactured by outsourced labor in east asia then transported by container ships to ports on the u.s mainland and hawaii also receives the same goods being located in the central pacific ocean right between major pacific shipping lanes it would be very economical to unload hawaiian-bound goods in honolulu before continuing on to the mainland however this would effectively make the second leg of the voyage between hawaii and the mainland a domestic route between two american ports because most large cargo ships operate under foreign flags of convenience such as liberia vanuatu or papua new guinea allowing them to avoid the more stringent and thus more costly regulations of developed nations ports the domestic leg of the voyage would be disallowed by the jones act instead those cargo ships must proceed directly to the west coast where distributors break bulk and transport the hawaiian-bound asian-manufactured goods back across the ocean by u.s.-flagged ships and increasing the length of the voyage by more than 50  this highly inefficient system of shipping hawaii s consumer cargo comes at a very hefty price for the average hawaiian citizen and makes the cost of living in hawaii much much higher than it would otherwise be 156 157 hawaiian consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods imposed by the jones act this law makes hawaii less competitive than west coast ports as a shopping destination for tourists from countries with much higher taxes like japan even though prices for asian-manufactured goods should be cheaper because hawaii is much closer than mainland states to asia 158 159 culture main article culture of the native hawaiians the aboriginal culture of hawaii is polynesian hawaii represents the
