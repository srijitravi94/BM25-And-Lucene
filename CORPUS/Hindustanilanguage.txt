hindustani हिन्दुस्तानी a ہندوستانی‎ b ˌɦɪnd̪ʊsˈt̪aːniː  lit of hindustan 7  historically also known as hindavi dehlavi and rekhta is the lingua franca of north india and pakistan 8 9 it is an indo-aryan language deriving its base primarily from the khariboli dialect of delhi the language incorporates a large amount of vocabulary from sanskrit persian and arabic 10 11 it is a pluricentric language with two official forms modern standard hindi and modern standard urdu 12 which are its standardised registers and which may be called hindustani or hindi-urdu when taken together 13 the colloquial registers are mostly indistinguishable and even though the official standards are nearly identical in grammar they differ in literary conventions and in academic and technical vocabulary with urdu adopting stronger persian and arabic influences and hindi relying more heavily on sanskrit 14 15 before the partition of the british indian empire the terms hindustani urdu and hindi were synonymous all covered what would be mostly called urdu and hindi today 16 the term hindustani is still used for the colloquial language and the lingua franca of north india and pakistan for example for the language of bollywood films as well as for several quite different varieties of hindi spoken outside the indian subcontinent such as fiji hindi of fiji and the caribbean hindustani of trinidad and tobago guyana suriname and the rest of the caribbean hindustani is also spoken by a small number of people in mauritius and south africa citation needed history edit main article history of hindustani early forms of present-day hindustani developed from the middle indo-aryan apabhramsha vernaculars of present-day north india in the 7th–13th centuries 17 amir khusro who lived in the 13th century ce during the delhi sultanate period in north india used these forms which was the lingua franca of the period in his writings and referred to it as hindavi 17 the delhi sultanate which comprised several turkic and afghan dynasties that ruled from delhi 18 was succeeded by the mughal empire in 1526. although the mughals were of timurid gurkānī turko-mongol descent 19 they were persianised and persian had gradually become the state language of the mughal empire after babur 20 21 22 23 a continuation since the introduction of persian by central asian turkic rulers in the indian subcontinent 24 and the patronisation of it by the earlier turko-afghan delhi sultanate the basis in general for the introduction of persian language into the subcontinent was set from its earliest days by various persianised central asian turkic and afghan dynasties 25 in the 18th century towards the end of the mughal period with the fragmentation of the empire and the elite system a variant of khariboli one of the successors of apabhramsha vernaculars at delhi and nearby cities came to gradually replace persian as the lingua franca among the educated elite upper class particularly in northern india though persian still retained much of its pre-eminence for a short period the term hindustani literally of hindustan was the name given to that variant of khariboli for socio-political reasons though essentially the variant of khariboli with persian vocabulary the emerging prestige dialect became also known as urdu properly zabān-e urdu-e mo alla language of the court or zabān-e urdu زبان اردو‎ ज़बान-ए उर्दू language of the camp in persian derived from turkic ordū camp  cognate with english horde due to its origin as the common speech of the mughal army  the more highly persianised version later established as a language of the court was called rekhta or mixed  as an emerging common dialect hindustani absorbed large numbers of persian arabic and turkic words and as mughal conquests grew it spread as a lingua franca across much of northern india written in the perso-arabic script or devanagari script 26 it remained the primary lingua franca of northern india for the next four centuries although it varied significantly in vocabulary depending on the local language and achieved the status of a literary language alongside persian in muslim courts its development was centred on the poets of the mughal courts of cities in uttar pradesh such as delhi lucknow and agra john fletcher hurst in his book published in 1891 mentioned that the hindustani or camp language or language of the camps of moughal courts at delhi was not regarded by philologists as distinct language but only as a dialect of hindi with admixture of persian he continued but it has all the magnitude and importance of separate language it is linguistic result of muslim rule of eleventh twelfth centuries and is spoken except in rural bengal by many hindus in north india and by musalman population in all parts of india  next to english it was the official language of british indian empire was commonly written in arabic or persian characters and was spoken by approximately 100,000,000 people 27 when the british colonised the indian subcontinent from the late 18th through to the late 19th century they used the words hindustani  hindi and urdu interchangeably they developed it as the language of administration of british india 28 further preparing it to be the official language of modern india and pakistan however with independence use of the word hindustani declined being largely replaced by hindi and urdu  or hindi-urdu when either of those was too specific more recently the word hindustani has been used for the colloquial language of bollywood films which are popular in both india and pakistan and which cannot be unambiguously identified as either hindi or urdu registers edit see also hindi–urdu controversy and register sociolinguistics although at the spoken level hindi and urdu are considered registers of a single language they differ vastly in literary and formal vocabulary where literary hindi draws heavily on sanskrit and to a lesser extent prakrit literary urdu draws heavily on persian and arabic the grammar and base vocabulary most pronouns verbs adpositions etc of both hindi and urdu however are the same and derive from a prakritic base and both have a persian arabic influence the standardised registers hindi and urdu are collectively known as hindi-urdu hindustani is perhaps the lingua franca of the north and west of the indian subcontinent though it is understood fairly well in other regions also especially in the urban areas a common vernacular sharing characteristics with sanskritised hindi regional hindi and urdu hindustani is more commonly used as a vernacular than highly sanskritised hindi or highly arabicised persianised urdu this can be seen in the popular culture of bollywood or more generally the vernacular of north indians and pakistanis which generally employs a lexicon common to both hindi and urdu speakers minor subtleties in region will also affect the brand of hindustani sometimes pushing the hindustani closer to urdu or to hindi one might reasonably assume that the hindustani spoken in lucknow uttar pradesh known for its usage of urdu and varanasi a holy city for hindus and thus using highly sanskritised hindi is somewhat different modern standard hindi edit rigveda manuscript in devanagari early 19th century main article hindi standard hindi one of the official languages of india is based on the khariboli dialect of the delhi region and differs from urdu in that it is usually written in the indigenous devanagari script of india and exhibits less persian and arabic influence than urdu many scholars today employ a sanskritised form of hindi developed primarily in varanasi the hindu holy city which is based on the eastern hindi dialect of that region and thus a separate language from official standard hindi citation needed it has a literature of 500 years with prose poetry religion philosophy under the bahmani kings and later on khutab shahi adil shahi etc it is a living language still prevalent all over the deccan plateau note that the term hindustani has generally fallen out of common usage in modern india except to refer to indian as a nationality 29 and a style of indian classical music prevalent in northern india the term used to refer to it is hindi or urdu depending on the religion of the speaker and regardless of the mix of persian or sanskrit words used by the speaker one could conceive of a wide spectrum of dialects and registers with the highly persianised urdu at one end of the spectrum and a heavily sanskrit-based dialect spoken in the region around varanasi at the other end of the spectrum in common usage in india the term hindi includes all these dialects except those at the urdu end of the spectrum thus the different meanings of the word hindi include among others standardised hindi as taught in schools throughout india except some states such as tamil nadu  formal or official hindi advocated by purushottam das tandon and as instituted by the post-independence indian government heavily influenced by sanskrit the vernacular dialects of hindustani as spoken throughout india the neutralised form of hindustani used in popular television and films or the more formal neutralised form of hindustani used in broadcast and print news reports modern standard urdu edit the phrase zabān-e urdu-e mo alla written in nasta liq calligraphy main article urdu urdu is the national language of pakistan and an officially recognised regional language of india urdu is the official language of all pakistani provinces and is taught in all schools as a compulsory subject up to the 12th grade it is also an official language in the indian states of jammu and kashmir national capital territory of delhi uttar pradesh bihar telangana that have significant muslim populations bazaar hindustani edit main article hindi dialects in a specific sense hindustani may be used to refer to the dialects and varieties used in common speech in contrast with the standardised hindi and urdu this meaning is reflected in the use of the term bazaar hindustani in other words the language of the street or the marketplace  as opposed to the perceived refinement of formal hindi urdu or even sanskrit thus the webster s new world dictionary defines the term hindustani as the principal dialect of hindi urdu used as a trade language throughout north india and pakistan names edit amir khusro ca 1300 referred to this language of his writings as dahlavi of delhi or hindavi हिन्दवी ہندوی‎ of hindustan  during this period hindustani was used by sufis in promulgating their message across the indian subcontinent 30 after the advent of the mughals in the subcontinent hindustani acquired more persian loanwords rekhta mixture and hindi of hindustan 26 became popular names for the same language until the 18th century 31 the name urdu appeared around 1780. 31 during the british raj the term hindustani was used by british officials 31 in 1796, john borthwick gilchrist published a a grammar of the hindoostanee language  31 32 upon partition india and pakistan established national standards that they called hindi and urdu respectively and attempted to make distinct with the result that hindustani commonly but mistakenly came to be seen as a mixture of hindi and urdu grierson in his highly influential linguistic survey of india proposed that the names hindustani urdu and hindi be separated in use for different varieties of the hindustani language rather than as the overlapping synonyms they frequently were we may now define the three main varieties of hindōstānī as follows —hindōstānī is primarily the language of the upper gangetic doab and is also the lingua franca of india capable of being written in both persian and dēva-nāgarī characters and without purism avoiding alike the excessive use of either persian or sanskrit words when employed for literature the name urdū can then be confined to that special variety of hindōstānī in which persian words are of frequent occurrence and which hence can only be written in the persian character and similarly hindī can be confined to the form of hindōstānī in which sanskrit words abound and which hence can only be written in the dēva-nāgarī character 33 literature edit main articles hindi literature and urdu

respect as shuddha hindi urdu is also the national language of pakistan where it shares official language status with english although english is spoken by many punjabi is the native language of the majority of the population urdu is the lingua franca hindustani was the official language of the british indian empire and was synonymous with both hindi and urdu 28 35 36 after india s independence in 1947, the sub-committee on fundamental rights recommended that the official language of india be hindustani hindustani written either in devanagari or the perso-arabic script at the option of the citizen shall as the national language be the first official language of the union 37 however this recommendation was not adopted by the constituent assembly hindustani outside south asia edit besides being the lingua franca of north india and pakistan in south asia hindustani is also spoken by many in the south asian diaspora and their descendants around the world including north america in canada for example hindustani is one of the fastest growing languages 38 and the middle east hindustani was also one of the languages that was spoken widely in burma during british rule many older burmese

perso-arabic script nastaliq which is preferred calligraphic style for urdu today hindustani continues to be written in the urdu alphabet and this is nearly exclusive in pakistan in india the hindi register is officially written in devanagari a relative of kaithi  and urdu in perso-arabic script nastaliq to the extent that these standards are partly defined by their script however in popular publications in india urdu is also written in devanagari script with slight variations to establish a devanagari urdu alphabet alongside the devanagari hindi alphabet devanagari अ आ इ ई उ ऊ ए ऐ ओ औ ə
