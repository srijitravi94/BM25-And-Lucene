season hurricane allen was a rare and extremely powerful cape verde-type hurricane that struck the caribbean eastern and northern mexico and southern texas in august 1980. the first named storm and first tropical cyclone of the 1980 atlantic hurricane season it was one of the strongest hurricanes in recorded history it was one of the few hurricanes to reach category 5 status on the saffir–simpson hurricane scale on three separate occasions and spent more time as a category 5 than all but two other atlantic hurricanes allen is the only hurricane in the recorded history of the atlantic basin to achieve sustained winds of 190 mph 305 km h  nb 1 thus making it the strongest atlantic hurricane by wind speed until hurricane patricia in 2015, these were also the highest sustained winds in the western hemisphere throughout its life allen moved through the deep tropics on a westerly to north-westerly course through the tropical atlantic ocean caribbean sea and gulf of mexico before making its final landfall near the united states–mexico border at peak strength it passed near haiti causing hundreds of deaths and heavy damage after crossing the gulf of mexico allen weakened as it struck the lower texas coast causing high winds a significant storm surge and heavy rainfall which caused damage to southern texas overall allen killed at least 269 people and left just over 7009124000000000000♠1.24 billion in damages 1980 us dollars  or 4.00 billion in 2016 dollars mostly within the united states and haiti because of its impact the name allen was retired from the six-year revolving list of atlantic tropical cyclone names in 1981 and the name was replaced by andrew the name andrew was subsequently retired after the 1992 season s hurricane andrew the remnants of the storm precipitated the end of the heat wave of 1980 in places like dallas fort worth texas which had recorded 69 days of 100 °f 38 °c heat meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale allen was an early cape verde-type hurricane which originated from a tropical wave that previously moved off the african coastline on july 30. the system developed as it moved westward becoming a tropical depression on august 1. 1 however the national hurricane center did not initiate advisories on allen until almost 24 hours later when it was centered 1,300 mi 2,100 km east of the windward islands 2 early on august 2, as the depression moved towards the caribbean it had intensified and became the first named storm of the season 1 the national hurricane center noted that conditions appeared favorable for further intensification however it was also noted that a large cold-low north of puerto rico was producing strong westerly wind shear which would cause allen to possibly encounter unfavorable conditions within 72 hours 3 although slower forward movement was anticipated 4 allen remained at generally the same westward pace between 17 and 23 mph 27 and 37 km h  1 by august 3, the national hurricane center retracted predictions of less favorable conditions from the cold-low north of puerto rico since that weather system was weakening and moving westward 5 most intense atlantic hurricanes rank hurricane season pressure hpa inhg 1 wilma 2005 882 26.05 2 gilbert 1988 888 26.23 3 labor day 1935 892 26.34 4 rita 2005 895

season 10 by august 5, allen intensified into a category 5 hurricane while south of puerto rico this made allen the earliest category 5 hurricane in the atlantic on record 1 but was later surpassed by hurricane emily which reached that intensity on july 16, 2005. during this time allen attained a central pressure of 911 mbar 911 hpa 26.9 inhg  the lowest pressure on record in the eastern caribbean sea hence the barometric pressure dropped by 35 mbar 35 hpa 1.0 inhg less than 10 hours after the national hurricane center stated that the pressure would not decrease significantly within the time of 24 hours the eye passed between hispaniola and jamaica as a category 4 hurricane after friction with the mountains of haiti and jamaica had caused it to weaken allen intensified back to a category 5 hurricane retaining this intensity for over a day it then moved past the islands of cayman brac and little cayman causing moderate damage on cayman brac with winds near 135 mph the storm then moved between cuba and the yucatán peninsula reaching its peak intensity of 190 mph 310 km h and a minimum pressure of 899 mbar 899 hpa 26.5 inhg while crossing the yucatán channel during allen s trek through the caribbean sea and the gulf of mexico its center of circulation never crossed over land despite its close passage to various islands in and around the caribbean sea 6 allen again weakened to a category 4 storm due to friction with mexico and an eyewall replacement cycle but restrengthened into a category 5 hurricane for a third time as it moved over the open waters of the gulf of mexico keeping this intensity for nearly a full day and with a pressure drop to 909 mbar 909 hpa 26.8 inhg  the lowest pressure ever recorded in the western gulf of mexico shortly before landfall a dry air mass in the western gulf of mexico caused the storm to weaken substantially allen made landfall north of brownsville texas as a category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph 185 km

allen spawned several tornadoes in texas one tornado caused 100 million in damage when it hit austin texas making it the costliest tropical cyclone-spawned tornado in recorded history overall however the storm caused limited damage in the united states due to its suddenly diminished power and because its highest tides and winds hit a sparsely-populated portion of the texas coast 16 26 allen dumped 10 inches 250 mm to 20 inches 510 mm of rain in south texas ending a summer-long drought during the heat wave of 1980. 27 retirement and records edit see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names

intensity on august 5, it became the earliest category 5 storm ever recorded this record stood until hurricane emily surpassed it on july 16, 2005. allen is one of three atlantic hurricanes to reach category 5 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale on three separate occasions the others being hurricane ivan and hurricane isabel allen also produced the fifth-lowest minimum pressure ever recorded in the atlantic basin at 899 mbar hpa and was the strongest known hurricane in the basin in terms of pressure since 1935. until then it was the second strongest hurricane by pressure in the atlantic basin but was since pushed down to fifth and no hurricane has achieved 190 miles per hour 310 km h winds in this basin since then 30 it remains the most intense storm ever in august allen spent nearly 3 days as a category 5 storm initially the longest stretch of any previous atlantic hurricane on record however a reanalysis of the 1932 cuba hurricane showed that it spent 3 hours longer at category 5 intensity than allen 6 and hurricane irma in 2017 also spent slightly more time as a category 5 hurricane than allen five typhoons have spent longer as category 5 storms including most recently karen and nancy in the early 1960s 31
