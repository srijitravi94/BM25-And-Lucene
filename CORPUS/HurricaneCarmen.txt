storm carmen originated as a tropical disturbance that emerged from africa toward the end of august the disturbance traveled westward spawning a tropical depression east of the lesser antilles on august 29. the storm moved through the caribbean sea and in an environment conducive to intensification it quickly strengthened to its initial peak intensity as a category 4 hurricane on the saffir–simpson hurricane scale carmen moved ashore on the yucatán peninsula where despite striking a sparsely populated region it caused significant crop damage and killed several people before the storm s arrival officials had set up several evacuation centers and many residents had moved to higher ground upon entering the gulf of mexico carmen turned northward and re-intensified as it approached the united states initially threatening the major city of new orleans it veered westward and made landfall on the marshland of southern louisiana eventually dissipating over eastern texas on september 10. tropical cyclone watches and warnings had been issued for the storm and approximately 100,000 residents left their homes and sought shelter damage was lighter than first feared but the sugar industry suffered substantial losses throughout its course the hurricane killed 8 people and caused 162 million in damage due to the severity of the storm the name carmen was retired from the list of atlantic tropical cyclone names meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale the origins of hurricane carmen can be traced to a weather disturbance over africa during the middle of august 1974. the disturbance moved slowly westward with little convective activity initially although upon entering the atlantic ocean it spawned a tropical wave within the intertropical convergence zone the wave had intensified and broadened by august 25, and it eventually split into two components the northernmost of which consolidated into an organized storm system 1 moving westward the system developed into a tropical depression on august 29, more than 200 mi 320 km east of guadeloupe 2 due to favorable outflow from an anticyclone nearby the depression gradually strengthened as it moved through the lesser antilles 3 it attained tropical storm status on august 30, south of puerto rico 2 and was named carmen by the national hurricane center 4 at first the storm s proximity to hispaniola prevented further strengthening 5 but by august 31, it had managed to intensify into a category 1 hurricane on the saffir–simpson hurricane scale 2 as carmen passed south of jamaica an eye feature briefly appeared 6 on september 1, the hurricane began to rapidly deepen over warm waters of the caribbean sea by 1800 coordinated universal time utc  it had strengthened to category 4 intensity 2 continuing westward the storm passed north of swan island later that day 3 early on september 2, a double eyewall appeared on satellite imagery 7 carmen s forward movement gradually slowed as the storm took a west by north direction 8 and it reached its initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph 240 km h  accompanied by a central barometric pressure of 928 mbar hpa 27.4 inhg  2 atmospheric steering currents became increasingly weaker and carmen slowed to a drift 9 later on september 2, the hurricane made landfall on the yucatán peninsula its northern jog spared belize city from a direct hit the storm s center passed a few miles north of chetumal quintana roo 2 the cyclone drifted inland deteriorating to a tropical storm on september 3. 2 about a day later carmen emerged into the gulf of mexico where it nearly stalled turning northward the storm regained hurricane strength on september 5. 2 carmen continued to strengthen and accelerated northward towards the united states gulf coast 3 reaching a forward speed of 12 mph 19 km h at 0000 utc on september 7, it once again became a category 3 major hurricane 2 the storm reached its second peak intensity while located south of louisiana although the wind speeds were identical to that of its initial peak the barometric pressure was slightly higher carmen weakened and veered westward before landfall ultimately striking south-central louisiana after moving ashore the hurricane quickly lost strength and late on september 9 degenerated into a tropical depression the depression moved westward and soon dissipated over eastern texas 2 preparations edit hurricane carmen in the gulf of mexico near landfall in louisiana initial reactions to the approaching hurricane in the yucatán peninsula were regarded as calm by the united states media mexican officials declared an emergency alert by september 2, although they did not advise any evacuations meteorologists in the united states urged those living near the coast to move inland immediately 10 fearing significant loss of life and property the red

units and relief teams were prepared for deployment following the storm s passage 11 many of the nearly 35,000 residents in and around the city of chetumal evacuated to higher ground 12 although it initially threatened the united states city of new orleans the hurricane turned west prior to making landfall and spared the area from severe damage 3 contrary to its actual path forecasters predicted the hurricane to execute an eastward swerve toward florida had the cyclone instead continued northward and traveled over lake pontchartrain low-lying areas could have suffered catastrophic flooding 13 over 100,000 residents of the gulf coast mostly in louisiana and mississippi evacuated in advance of the hurricane 14 causing heavy congestion on highways 13 about 60,000 people sought shelter in facilities across the new orleans region according to red cross officials 15 hurricane warnings were issued along the coast while coast guard personnel went door-to-door on grand isle urging residents to leave the area from there through the coast of southwestern florida small craft were advised to remain near shore due to rough seas 16 offshore workers were removed from oil rigs 17 many mississippi citizens having experienced the destruction of hurricane camille just five years earlier quickly left their coastal homes 18 impact edit as a tropical depression and storm carmen produced moderate rainfall across puerto rico and the northern lesser antilles peaking at 5.91 in 150 mm in jajome alto puerto rico 19 the storm spawned a tornado on puerto rico and triggered flash flooding

radar image of hurricane carmen near landfall on september 2 although carmen made landfall as a powerful category 4 hurricane it caused significantly less damage than anticipated because it struck a sparsely populated region however torrential rainfall from the storm inundated farmland across the region ruining rice crops the fishing industry also sustained major losses communication with the

were confined to strewn debris and a few downed trees 34 because carmen moved ashore over uninhabited marshland it caused far less damage than initially feared 35 nonetheless tidal flooding from the gulf of mexico and coastal bodies of water was severe freshwater flooding was less extreme in total the storm inundated 2,380,500 acres 963,400 ha of land in louisiana including 742,300 acres 300,400

salinity in coastal marshes and water bodies the sudden intrusion of saltwater stressed delicate plants fish shrimp and oysters also suffered the ecological effects of hurricane carmen flooding on
