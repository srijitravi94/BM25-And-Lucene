landfall in southwestern florida at maximum strength making it the strongest hurricane to hit the united states since hurricane andrew struck florida in 1992. after moving slowly through the caribbean sea charley crossed cuba on friday august 13 as a category 3 hurricane causing heavy damage and four deaths that same day it crossed over the dry tortugas just 22 hours after tropical storm bonnie had struck northwestern florida it was the first time in history that two tropical cyclones struck the same state in a 24-hour period 1 at its peak intensity of 150 mph 240 km h  hurricane charley struck the northern tip of captiva island and the southern tip of north captiva island before crossing over bokeelia causing severe damage 2  charley the strongest hurricane to hit southwest florida since hurricane donna in 1960, then continued to produce severe damage as it made landfall on the peninsula in punta gorda it continued to the north-northeast along the peace river corridor devastating punta gorda port charlotte cleveland fort ogden nocatee arcadia zolfo springs sebring and wauchula zolfo springs was isolated for nearly two days as masses of large trees power poles power lines

eastern parts of the orlando metropolitan area still carrying winds gusting up to 106 mph 171 km h  the city of winter park north of orlando also sustained considerable damage since its many old large oak trees had not experienced high winds falling trees tore down power utilities and smashed cars and their huge roots lifted underground water and sewer utilities the storm slowed as it exited the

the state totaled to over 13 billion 2004 usd  charley initially was expected to hit further north in tampa and caught many floridians off-guard due to a sudden change in the storm s track as it approached the state throughout the united states charley caused 10 deaths and 15.4 billion in damage to insured residential property making it the second costliest hurricane in united states history at the time it has since dropped to ninth  5 charley was a compact fast-moving storm which limited the scope and severity of the damage meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale charley began as a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of africa on august 4. 3 it moved quickly westward and steadily organized over the open atlantic ocean with convection developing in curved bands 3 the wave continued to develop as it approached the lesser antilles and became tropical depression three on august 9 while 115 mi 185 km south-southeast of barbados near the island of grenada however the threat to barbados was short-lived 3 6 low upper-level wind shear and well-defined outflow contributed to further intensification and the depression strengthened on august 10, despite being located in the eastern caribbean sea which is an area not particularly suited to tropical cyclogenesis 4 at this time the national hurricane center in miami designated the name charley 3 hurricane charley approaching cuba on august 12 a strong ridge of high pressure to the system s north forced charley to change track quickly to the west-northwest it continued to strengthen and became a category 1 hurricane on august 11, while 90 mi 140 km south of kingston jamaica 3 6 the storm was being steered around the periphery of the high pressure area and as a result charley changed direction toward the northwest the following day the core passed 40 mi 64 km southwest of jamaica affecting the island on august 11 and 12. 4 6 the storm then passed 15 mi 24 km northeast of grand cayman reaching category 2 status just after passing the island 3 4 the hurricane continued to strengthen as it turned to the northwest and rounded the southwest portion of the subtropical ridge becoming a major hurricane—a storm classified as a category 3 hurricane or higher—just before making landfall on southern cuba 3 charley came ashore near punta cayamas with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph 190 km h and gusts of up to 133 mph 214 km h  at about 0430 utc on august 13. 6 it weakened while crossing the island passing about 15 mi 24 km west of downtown havana before weakening to 110 mph 180 km h  3 after crossing cuba near menelao mora hurricane charley accelerated to the north-northeast toward the southwest coast of florida in response to the approach of an unseasonal mid-tropospheric trough 6 charley passed over the dry tortugas at 1200 utc on august 13, with maximum winds of about 110 mph 180 km h  3 4 the strike occurred only 22 hours after tropical storm bonnie made landfall on st vincent island marking the first time two tropical cyclones hit the same state within a 24-hour period 1 then charley rapidly intensified strengthening from a 110 mph 180 km h hurricane with a minimum central barometric pressure of 965 mbar hpa 28.50 inhg to a 145 mph 233 km h hurricane with a pressure of 947 mbar hpa 27.96 inhg in just three hours it continued to strengthen as it turned more to the northeast and made landfall near the island of cayo costa florida as a 150 mph 240 km h category 4 hurricane with a pressure of 941 mbar hpa 27.79 inhg at approximately 1945 utc on august 13. 4 7 an hour later the hurricane struck punta gorda as a 145 mph 233 km h storm and then passed up through port charlotte 3 however the eye had shrunk before landfall limiting the most powerful winds to an area within 7 mi 11 km of the center 3 charley weakened considerably due to its passage over land but still retained sustained winds of about 85 mph 137 km h as it passed directly over orlando between 0020 and 0140 utc august 14, gusts of up to 106 mph 171 km h were recorded at orlando international airport 4 it cut a swath of destruction across florida also passing near kissimmee 3 the hurricane reemerged into the atlantic ocean after crossing directly over new smyrna beach as a category 1 hurricane but restrengthened slightly over open waters 3 4 continuing to move rapidly to the north-northeast charley struck near cape romain national wildlife refuge south carolina as an 80 mph 130 km h hurricane moved offshore briefly and made its final landfall near north myrtle beach as a minimal hurricane with winds of 75 mph 121 km h  4 charley then began interacting with an approaching frontal boundary becoming a tropical storm over southeastern north carolina 4 after moving back into the atlantic ocean near virginia beach on august 15, the storm became extratropical and became embedded in the frontal zone 3 4 the extratropical storm continued to move rapidly to the northeast and was completely absorbed by the front shortly after sunrise on august 15, near southeastern massachusetts 3 4 preparations edit nexrad image of hurricane charley over punta gorda florida just after landfall on august 10, two days before the hurricane passed near the island jamaican officials issued a tropical storm warning

elsewhere throughout florida 3 because of the threat 1.9 million people along the florida west coast were urged to evacuate including 380,000 residents in the tampa bay area and 11,000 in the florida keys 12 13 14 it was the largest evacuation order for pinellas county history 14 and the largest evacuation request in florida since hurricane floyd five years before many floridians remained despite the evacuation order as authorities estimated that up to a million people would not go to shelters 15 instead these residents boarded up their homes and bought supplies to ride out the storm 13 however about 1.42 million people evacuated their homes in florida and approximately 50,000 residents were placed in shelters throughout the state 16 17 power companies mobilized workers to prepare

reroute their paths 13 and forced rail service between miami and new york to shut down 19 charley making landfall on august 13, 2004. the rapid strengthening of charley in the eastern gulf of mexico caught many by surprise around five hours before its florida landfall charley was a strong category 2 hurricane predicted to strengthen its strongest winds to 115 mph 185 km h upon its landfall in the tampa-saint petersburg area 20 about two hours before landfall the national hurricane center issued a special advisory notifying the public that charley had become a 145 mph 233 km h category 4 hurricane with a predicted landfall location in the port charlotte area 21 as a result of this change in forecast numerous people in the charlotte county area were unprepared for the hurricane despite the fact that the new track prediction was well within the previous forecast s margin of error national hurricane center forecasting intern robbie berg publicly blamed the media for misleading residents into believing that a tampa landfall was inevitable in addition he also stated that residents of port charlotte had ample warning 22 as a hurricane warning had been issued for the landfall area 23 hours before and a hurricane watch had existed for 35 hours 3 several local meteorologists however did depart from the official predictions of a tampa bay landfall as early as the morning of august 13. jim farrell 23 of wink robert van winkle wbbh steve jerve of wfla in tampa jim reif of wzvn in fort myers and tom terry of wftv in orlando all broke with their national news forecasts and

forecasters estimated that charley struck southern cuba as a 105 mph 169 km h category 2 hurricane on the saffir-simpson scale 34 in post-hurricane-season analysis charley was determined to have struck southern cuba as a 120 mph 190 km h hurricane the original estimate was revised based on a report of a 118 mph 190 km h sustained wind measurement in playa baracoa and meant that charley was a major hurricane at landfall 6 the hurricane produced a storm surge of up to 13.1 ft 4.0 m in playa cajio 3 on the other hand charley s quick passage caused precipitation amounts to be small with the largest total 5.87 inches 149 mm occurring in mariel 6 strong wind gusts downed nearly 1,500 power lines and knocked over 28 large high tension wire towers at a power plant in mariel as a result more than half of the electricity customers in havana province were left without power for 12 days after the storm and all of pinar del río province was without power for over 11 days blackouts continued in areas where power returned the power outages resulted in lack of drinking water for numerous people including no potable water in the city of havana for four days as a result the cuban government

while moving northward to the west of the florida keys charley produced moderate winds of 48 mph 77 km h with gusts to 60 mph 97 km h in key west 3 the winds toppled a few trees power lines and unreinforced signs a boat knocked loose by strong waves struck a power transmission line causing widespread power outages from marathon to key west on fort jefferson in the dry tortugas the hurricane

minimal in the area totaling 160,000. 12 damage in captiva island hurricane charley passed directly over captiva island near cayo costa with peak winds of 150 mph 240 km h  3 the category 4 hurricane produced an estimated storm surge of up to 6.5 ft 2.0 m on the island which is lower than expected for a storm of its intensity the decrease in the height of the surge was due to the hurricane s small size and its rapid intensification just prior to landfall furthermore the storm surge combined with the strong pressure gradient produced a ¼ mi 450 m inlet on north captiva island 36 known as charley s cut strong waves and storm surge caused severe beach erosion and dune damage at various locations the storm severely damaged five houses lightly damaged many others and downed many trees on
