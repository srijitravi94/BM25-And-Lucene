of the season in july the hurricane set several records for early season hurricane activity becoming the strongest atlantic hurricane ever to form before august a title it held for only six days before being surpassed by hurricane emily dennis hit cuba twice as a category 4 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale and made landfall on the florida panhandle in the united states as a category 3 storm less than a year after hurricane ivan did so dennis killed 88 people—76 directly and 12 indirectly—in the u.s and caribbean and caused 2.23 billion 2005 usd in damages to the united states as well as an approximately equal amount of damage in the caribbean primarily on cuba meteorological history edit main article meteorological history of hurricane dennis map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale the incipient tropical wave that became dennis was identified on june 26, 2005, well-inland over africa 1 2 3 it later emerged over the atlantic ocean on june 29 and moved briskly to the west 1 dry air initially inhibited development 4 5 though once this abated the wave was able to consolidate into a tropical depression on july 4. 1 the depression soon crossed grenada before entering the caribbean sea whereupon increasingly favorable environmental factors such as low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures fueled intensification 6 7 8 turning west-northwest the system achieved tropical storm status on july 5 and hurricane status the following day 1 formation of a well-defined eye and central dense overcast signaled dennis s intensification into a major hurricane on july 7. 1 9 throughout this phase the hurricane traversed the jamaica channel bringing deadly floods to both jamaica and haiti 1 the powerful storm soon struck granma province cuba as a category 4 early on july 8 violent winds battered the province and caused extensive damage briefly weakening due to interaction with land dennis quickly regained its strength paralleling the western coast of cuba dennis attained its peak winds of 150 mph 240 km h later that day before making a second landfall in the country this time in matanzas province 1 resumed interaction with the mountains of cuba caused significant weakening 10 however once dennis emerged over the gulf of mexico on july 9, it was able to quickly reorganize the hurricane reached category 4 strength for a third time on july 10 as it approached florida attaining its lowest barometric pressure of 930 mbar hpa 27.46 inhg  1 this ranked dennis as the strongest pre-august hurricane in the atlantic basin however this was eclipsed just six days later by hurricane emily which was the first july category 5 on record 11 12 weakening ensued as the hurricane approached the florida panhandle ultimately making landfall over santa rosa island on july 10 as a category 3. dramatic weakening ensued once the cyclone moved ashore dennis lingered as a tropical depression and remnant low for roughly a week traversing the mississippi river valley and ohio river valley before finally dissipating over ontario on july 18. 1 preparations edit caribbean edit in

dennis in georgia and effects of hurricane dennis in mississippi in the united states damage was not as high as originally expected mainly because dennis was more compact and moved more quickly than initially forecast dennis made landfall approximately 30 miles 48 km to the east of where hurricane ivan had made landfall 10 months before but did not cause as much damage as ivan due to its quicker speed compact size and because the area was not fully rebuilt dennis moved about 7 mph 11 km h faster than ivan at landfall and had hurricane-force winds that only extended 40 miles 65 km from its center compared to ivan s 105 miles 170 km h  14 33 during the height of the storm dennis produced storm surges as high as 9 ft 3 m in the apalachee bay region and as high as 7 ft 2 m on the florida
