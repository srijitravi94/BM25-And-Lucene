affected leeward islands bermuda eastern canada part of the 2003 atlantic hurricane season hurricane fabian was a powerful cape verde-type hurricane that hit bermuda in early september during the 2003 atlantic hurricane season fabian was the most recent major hurricane to directly impact bermuda until hurricane nicole of 2016. it was the sixth named storm fourth hurricane and first major hurricane of the season developed from a tropical wave in the tropical atlantic ocean on august 25. it moved west-northwestward under the influence of the subtropical ridge to its north and steadily strengthened in an area of warm water temperatures and light wind shear the hurricane attained a peak intensity of 145 mph 230 km h on september 1, and it slowly weakened as it turned northward on september 5, fabian made a direct hit on bermuda with wind speeds of over 120 mph 195 km h  after passing the island the hurricane turned to the northeast and became extratropical on september 8. 1 fabian was the strongest hurricane to hit bermuda since hurricane arlene in 1963. 2 it was both the most damaging and the first hurricane to cause a death on the island since 1926. 3 the hurricane s powerful winds resulted in moderate damage and destroyed roofs throughout the island a strong storm surge associated with the hurricane killed four people crossing a causeway on bermuda temporarily closing the only link between two islands the endangered bermuda petrel better known as the cahow was threatened by the hurricane which destroyed ten nests although volunteer work transported the species to a safer location strong swells resulted in damage in northern puerto rico and the dominican republic and also caused four people to drown along the united states atlantic coast in all fabian caused around us7008300000000000000♠ 300 million in damage and eight deaths meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale on august 25, a tropical wave emerged off the coast of africa 1 tracking westward the wave developed convection over its center and conducive conditions allowed it to develop further 4 the system passed through the cape verde islands later that day as convection steadily weakened 1 5 early on august 27, convection again increased and consolidated near the center and later that day the wave developed into tropical depression ten while located 420 miles 675 km west of the cape verde islands moving westward into an area of warm waters and low vertical shear the depression steadily intensified and was named tropical storm fabian on august 28 as convection increased and banding features became more prominent 1 6 banding features and outflow continued to develop as a ring of convection formed around the center of fabian 7 and on august 30, the storm intensified into a hurricane while gradually slowing its motion to the west-northwest 1 as banding features and outflow became better defined an eye developed in the center of the deepest convection 8 fabian quickly strengthened and attained major hurricane status late that day 1 deep convection became very concentric around the 11.5 mile 18.5 km wide eye and the hurricane reached winds of 125 mph 205 km h early on august 31. 9 at this time the deepest convection near the eye degraded in appearance and fabian temporarily stopped its strengthening trend 10 later that day the eye became distinct again within a perfectly round area of deep convection outflow continued to expand in all directions and fabian intensified into a category 4 hurricane late on august 31. 11 thunderstorm activity near the eyewall became more intense and the cloud tops in the eyewall became much cooler simultaneously outflow away from the eye became much more symmetrical both signs of an intensifying tropical cyclone fabian reached its peak intensity of 145 mph 230 km h on september 1 while located 345 miles 555 km east of the northern lesser antilles 12 hurricane fabian south of bermuda on september 5 after maintaining its peak intensity for 12 hours fabian degraded due to internal fluctuations and began to weaken 13 the hurricane turned to the northwest on september 2 in response to a weakness in the subtropical ridge a break caused by a mid-level circulation over the southwest atlantic ocean after fading back to a category 3 hurricane fabian re-intensified on september 4, and regained category 4 status for a short time the hurricane weakened again as it accelerated northward towards bermuda a motion due to an approaching mid-level trough 1 as small pockets of dry air became entrained in the eyewall fabian weakened slightly 14 passing just 14 miles 23 km west of bermuda on september 5 as a 115 mph 185 km h category 3 hurricane 1 the eastern portion of the eyewall moved over the island resulting in a direct hit however as the center did not move over the island fabian did not make landfall after passing the island the hurricane accelerated northeastward and weakened to a 105 mph 165 km h category 2 hurricane on september 7. 1 steady weakening occurred as the hurricane moved into an area of increasing wind shear drier air and progressively cooler waters 15 on september 8, while located 680 miles 1095 km east-northeast of cape race newfoundland fabian transitioned into an extratropical storm with no deep convection remaining near the center 16 the extratropical remnant turned to the north on september 9, and on september 10 it merged with another extratropical storm while located between southern greenland and iceland 1 preparations edit several days prior to fabian striking bermuda computer models forecast a ridge of high pressure forcing the hurricane to the west of the island by 200 miles 320 km  17 not expected to be a direct threat a meteorologist at the bermuda weather service expected gusty winds and potentially heavy rainfall 18 each successive advisory brought the hurricane steadily closer to bermuda 17 and 35 hours before fabian made its closest approach the bermuda weather service issued a hurricane watch for the island when a track near bermuda became more certain a hurricane warning was issued for the island approximately 29 hours before fabian made a direct hit on the island 1 the bermuda electric light company limited recommended bermuda residents to buy hurricane supplies such as candles batteries and non-perishable foods to fill bathtubs and extra containers with water and fill gasoline tanks for automobiles 19 in preparation residents formed long lines at gas stations banks 20 and supermarkets 21 all government offices and many businesses closed on the day prior to the hurricane hitting 20 all schools were closed while all flights in and out of the island were canceled officials opened emergency shelters and recommended 2,000 low-lying residents to evacuate 21 a hotel on the south shore of the island was evacuated as well 22 several cruise ships expected to remain on the island departed early to avoid the hurricane 21 local insurance companies on bermuda experienced a great increase in business as residents renewed lapsed policies or signed up for new policies for homes or businesses though marine policies were stopped several days before the hurricane struck 23 the arrival of fabian forced the cancellation or delay of several sports events including a cricket match a football game and a dinghy race 24 impact edit storm deaths by region region direct deaths bermuda 4 grand banks 3 north carolina 1 total 8 1 throughout its path fabian killed 8 people and caused us7008300000000000000♠ 300 million in damages primarily in bermuda caribbean edit the hurricane produced storm surge damage in antigua and barbuda where some boats were lightly damaged 25 strong swells and high tides produced large waves on the north coast of puerto rico washing out beaches in various locations waves knocked out a 10 ft 3 m portion of a construction site in ocean park resulting in us7004300000000000000♠ 30 thousand in damage 26 in the dominican republic the hurricane produced waves of up to 8 ft 2.4 m in height due to the waves and gusty winds boats were advised to stay at port several families had to be evacuated in nagua when rough seas flooded their homes 25 bermuda edit hurricane fabian over bermuda late on september 5 hurricane fabian struck bermuda on friday the 5 september 2003, with sustained winds having reached 39 mph 63 km h by 0800, 74 mph 119 km h by 1400, and 150 mph 240 km h by 1755. the eye did not pass directly over the archipelago instead passing to the west placing bermuda in the north-east quarter where the winds were particularly powerful with the eye wall dragging over bermuda for three hours this prolonged the damaging winds the island was subjected to 27 the storm produced a 10-minute average wind speed of 120 mph 195 km h  while a peak wind gust of 164 mph 264 km h occurred at bermuda harbour radio 1 the strongest of the winds lasted approximately three to four hours 17 and while the eastern portion of the eyewall moved over the island winds decreased to 60 mph 95 km h  1 large waves battered the southern portion of the island for several days reaching heights of 25 to 35 feet 7 to 10 m at the worst of the hurricane and upon passing the island the hurricane produced a storm surge exceeding 11 feet 3 m in height due to its fast motion rainfall totals rose to only 1.82 inches 46.2 mm  there were several unofficial reports of tornadoes as well 17 strong rip currents from the hurricane persisted for several days prior to fabian passing the island two swimmers were caught in the currents and relied on lifeguard assistance to return to shore as a result rip tide warnings were posted for the island 28 a house at john smith s bay during the approach of the storm strong waves caused extensive damage to the coastline especially on the southern portion of bermuda 17 the strong waves broke a boat from its moorings at spanish point not wanting to lose the ship the owner accompanied with two people tried to save the vessel one fell overboard before climbing aboard the boat the three ventured the vessel through tornadoes and 20-foot 6 m waves which dropped several feet of water in the ship however ultimately they safely arrived at hamilton harbour five charter boats capsized from the waves while several others crashed against reefs 29 strong waves collapsed a sea wall in hamilton causing traffic jams for one day until it was fixed 30 the winds downed numerous power lines causing 78 of the island s 32,031 power customers to experience power outages 17 the strong winds damaged or destroyed the roofs of numerous buildings on bermuda one of the areas lightest hit was around a hotel outside of hamilton which experienced no power outages or blown out windows 31 while one of the harder hit areas was warwick there one resident noted too many homes have lost roofs to count  one house was entirely destroyed on rec view hill while an unconfirmed tornado destroyed much of the roof of a house in devonshire 32 the hurricane destroyed a restaurant in southampton and also damaged stands and roofs at sports facilities 31 strong winds from the hurricane damaged several landmark buildings including the house of assembly and the city hall 22 both in hamilton and the former military headquarters in st george s damaged terminal at bermuda international airport structural damage was extensive at bermuda international airport bermuda international airport sustained 15 million in damages 33 primarily to buildings and roadways which were washed away by the storm surge the runway escaped major damage however and the airport re-opened the following day for emergency relief flights 34 confronting the damages in the storm s aftermath airport general manager james howes was quoted by the news media as saying my heart sank when i first saw the airport that morning there was tons of debris everywhere and all the fire alarms and security alarms were going off there was this din of bells and horns - it was like a war zone  35 commercial airline service was suspended for three days due to heavy damage to the terminal building which was flooded with 3 ft 0.91 m of seawater 36 the airport s ils and radar were also damaged the hurricane also affected the bermuda weather service as 8 ft 2.4 m waves destroyed recording equipment 30 the winds severely damaged the island s major hotels closing five for extended periods to repair damage one hotel that remained open experienced damage to 25 of its rooms 37 the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees along the island s golf courses though little damage was reported at most courses one course experienced significant damage at its club house temporarily closing it 38 government conservation officer dr david b wingate reported the damage to the south shore of bermuda was the worst in a thousand years 39 the strong winds blew down hundreds of trees caused severe damage to vegetation 17 and destroyed many of the island s indigenous plants 40 the hurricane washed away large sections of the nesting island for the endangered bermuda petrel and destroyed 10 of the 70 active nests the endangered birds were not on the island though local residents quickly gathered to restore their habitat 41 strong waves resulted in severe coastal erosion and at one beach the lack of sand destroyed a natural cove the natural arches a set of eroded stones resembling an arch that was popular in photographs was destroyed by the waves 42 the powerful winds knocked coconuts off several trees and scattered them across the ground 32 the storm surge from the hurricane stranded one vehicle with three police officers and another with a resident on the causeway between st george s parish and st david s island after a fire truck failed in its attempt to rescue them powerful waves washed the vehicles into castle harbour the united states coast guard and bermuda police divers mounted a full-scale search for the missing people during the worst of the storm the strong winds and emotional issues of searching for colleagues made the search difficult 43 ultimately the vehicles 22 and one dead body were recovered 17 with the others remaining missing presumably dead 22 another vehicle was on the causeway as the two cars became stranded though the driver was able to safely cross 43 high winds and surf tore off the causeway s side walls and greatly damaged the structure 22 temporarily closing it to automobile traffic 30 as most people were well-prepared these were the only four deaths on the island 17 in addition nine people sought medical attention for minor injuries 44 damage on bermuda totaled to us7008300000000000000♠ 300 million reportedly the worst to affect the area since 1926. 1 atlantic coast edit swells from the hurricane produced rip currents and heavy surf along the eastern north carolina coastline one man drowned near cape hatteras from the rip currents 45 fabian produced moderate surfing conditions along the east coast of the united states primarily from georgia to north carolina 46 three deaths were reported in the north atlantic when a ship the pacific attitude sank south of newfoundland in the grand banks due to strong waves of over 60 feet 20 m in height 1 47 aftermath edit road washout at bermuda international airport blocked roads initially caused delays to crews from the bermuda electric light company belco  which were attempting to restore power to the island of high priority among the places to be restored were the hospital as well as hotels to accommodate tourists who remained on the island through the storm 22 by the second day after the storm passed the island power was restored to 11,000 residents 48 power on bermuda was restored to all customers within three weeks of the hurricane but the electricity supply distribution system was greatly weakened this resulted in a rehabilitation plan implemented in october 2003. days after the hurricane passed moisture from tropical storm henri resulted in thunderstorms and heavy rainfall this hindered recovery efforts but did not cause any reported damage 17 lack of power caused interruptions to communications while an emergency broadcast station was installed and tested prior the hurricane the hurricane caused a problem to the system s back-up generator 49 the causeway in bermuda remained closed for several days after the hurricane as road crews made temporary repairs 30 upon being opened three days after the storm 48 traffic was limited to one lane of the original two however the causeway had to be closed in the event of rain winds exceeding 30 mph 48 km h  and at night 42 the bridge was fully repaired by early november 2003. 30 in the days after the storm people provided assistance for each other especially for the elderly 31 three days after the storm for example a radio station dj announced a name for an elderly person in need and within minutes someone would call to provide for their needs 42 residents cleared smaller roads from debris with chainsaws 31 which in turn helped the power companies to make repairs quickly 22 as a result of damage on their homes dozens of people stayed in five shelters or undamaged hotels 44 residents purchased large quantities of gasoline in the days after fabian some of whom bought over us 500 worth officials assured there was no shortage but requested drivers to conserve gas 50 xl capital ltd shipped 250 tarpaulins 10 electric generators and rope supply to the island 48 the uk government offered help to the island with two royal navy ships with supplies such as tents dried foods and blankets premier alex scott declined the offer believing the island could withstand on its own world vision also offered assistance with blankets tents and other supplies while two united states companies offered to send generators bermuda electric light company received aid from the caribbean electric organization which sent over 20 electricians to repair power lines 51 hurricane damage in bermuda initially the time for the destroyed vegetation on bermuda to regrow was estimated to take decades to help the south carolina maritime heritage foundation with support from a boy scout troop and nearby nurseries delivered 1,000 boxwood plants to the island 40 following the damage to the bermuda petrel s habitat bermuda s department of conservation carried out a translocation program which involved moving the habitat to nonsuch island that island a long-standing nature preserve was much higher and safer for the birds and by two years after the hurricane the population numbers were higher than before the storm 52 shortly after the hurricane the american home improvement franchise this old house unaware of the limited extent of damage decided to do a hurricane repair story upon realising that there would be little to nothing available for the ask this old house to repair it was decided instead to do a renovation of an 1805 home in st george s it was only the second time that the franchise had worked outside of the united states 53 a memorial to the four bermudians whose lives were claimed by hurricane fabian was subsequently erected near the causeway s east end by the airport where the 10th anniversary of their deaths was remembered by government officials in september 2013. 54 the onslaught of hurricane gonzalo in october 2014 prompted a catastrophe modeller to revisit fabian s destruction concluding that had it struck in 2014, it would have caused around 650 million in damage 55 retirement edit see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names due to the damage and deaths on bermuda the name fabian was retired in the spring of 2004 and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane as a result the bermuda weather service allowed residents to suggest a replacement name with the only rule being the name had to be a male name beginning with the letter f  able to be easily pronounced and not currently in use the service received a list of over 30 names including forrest and frodo after the character in the lord of the rings 56 the bermuda weather service sent three names to the world meteorological organization fred ford and flynn 57 the world meteorological organization ultimately replaced fabian with fred to be on the list for the 2009 season 25 fabian is one of only two tropical cyclones to have its name retired without making landfall anywhere with the other being klaus in 1990.
