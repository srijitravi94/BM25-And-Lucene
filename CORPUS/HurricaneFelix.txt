atlantic hurricane season hurricane felix was the southernmost landfalling category 5 hurricane in the atlantic surpassing hurricane edith of 1971. it was the sixth named storm second hurricane and second category 5 hurricane of the 2007 atlantic hurricane season felix formed from a tropical wave on august 31, passing through the southern windward islands on september 1 before strengthening to attain hurricane status a day later it rapidly strengthened into a major hurricane and early on september 3 it was upgraded to category 5 status by 2100 utc the hurricane was downgraded to category 4 status but was upgraded to a category 5 hurricane for the second and final time by the morning of september 4. on september 4, felix made landfall just south of the border between nicaragua and honduras in the mosquito coast region as a category 5 hurricane with 160 mph 260 km h winds hurricane felix struck nicaragua on the same day as hurricane henriette struck the baja california peninsula in the eastern pacific ocean which marked the second recorded occurrence that a north atlantic hurricane and a pacific hurricane made landfall on the same day 1 the previous occurrence was on august 23, 1992, when hurricane andrew hit the bahamas on the same day hurricane lester hit mexico s baja california peninsula at least 133 deaths are attributed to felix meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on august 24, tracking westward at approximately 14 mph 23 km h with no associated deep convection and a weak low-level inverted-v curvature 2 3 initially difficult to locate on satellites 4 the wave axis tracked through a moist environment 5 and developed an area of scattered thunderstorms by august 25 visible satellite imagery indicated broad cyclonic turning just north of the intertropical convergence zone 6 the wave continued to develop moderate to strong convection and on august 27 a 1012 mbar hpa 29.88 inhg low pressure area developed about 830 mi 1,340 km west-southwest of praia cape verde 7 for the next several days the system failed to organize significantly 8 however on august 30 the wave became better defined with more representation of the cyclonic turning into the low 9 convection increased early the next day 10 and a hurricane hunters flight into the system reported the presence of a closed low-level circulation accordingly the national hurricane center initiated advisories on tropical depression six at 2100 utc on august 31 while it was located about 180 mi 295 km east-southeast of the southern windward islands 11 upon becoming a tropical cyclone the depression was located to the south of a strong ridge resulting in a west-northwest motion the system maintained curved rainbands with expanding outflow and with light wind shear and warm water temperatures the environment favored further development 11 its deep convection consolidated very near the center and shortly after passing over the island of grenada the depression intensified into tropical storm felix early at around 0900 utc on september 1. 12 felix quickly strengthened as it developed a small inner core of convection with tightly-wound bands around the center 13 and by late on september 1 an eye feature was observed on satellite imagery 14 based on reports from reconnaissance aircraft the national hurricane center estimated that felix attained hurricane status by early on september 2 while located about 155 mi 250 km east-northeast of bonaire 15 hurricane felix rapidly intensifying south of hispaniola on september 2 tracking through an area of extremely low wind shear and increasingly high oceanic heat content felix quickly developed a well-defined eye a symmetric cloud structure and strong upper-level outflow 16 consequently the hurricane commenced explosive intensification shortly afterward felix attained major hurricane status at around 1800 utc on september 2 while located about 490 mi 790 km southeast of kingston jamaica 17 rapid strengthening continued and later that day the hurricane attained category 4 status on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale with the pressure dropping to 957 mbar hpa 28.26 inhg this corresponded to a falling rate of 3.4 mbar hpa 0.1 inhg per hour which the national hurricane center described as one of the more rapid deepening rates we have observed a hurricane hunters flight reported a stadium effect in the eye and also reported the eye diameter shrank to 14 mi 22 km  18 a subsequent hurricane hunters flight experienced flight level winds of 175 mph 280 km h  with peak surface winds of 163 mph 263 km h reported in the southwest quadrant of the eyewall surface winds of 189 mph 306 km h were found in its northeastern quadrant although the national hurricane center reported the peak reading could have been contaminated due to graupel in the clouds based on the observations it is estimated felix attained winds of 175 mph 280 km h by 0000 utc on september 3 while located about 390 mi 625 km southeast of kingston jamaica making felix a category 5 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale while investigating the hurricane hurricane hunters encountered extreme turbulence and potentially dangerous graupel which forced the flight to abort the mission 19 continuing quickly westward the diameter of the eye decreased to 12 mi 19 km  20 and the national hurricane center estimates the hurricane attained a minimum central pressure of 929 mbar hpa 27.43 inhg about seven hours after it reached category 5 status 2 initially felix was predicted to track west-northwestward striking belize before crossing the yucatán peninsula 20 however its path remained nearly due westward subsequently cloud tops near the center started to warm as the eye became less distinct 21 and by 1800 utc on september 3, felix weakened to category 4 status with winds of 145 mph 235 km h  22 on september 4, felix had completed an eyewall replacement cycle and began strengthening again during the day 23 felix was upgraded to a category 5 for the second time at 1040 utc 24 and made landfall in extreme north-eastern nicaragua shortly thereafter with winds of 160 mph 260 km h  25 by nine hours after moving ashore the system maintained a well-organized cloud pattern and intense rainbands although the winds rapidly decreased 26 early on september 5 felix weakened to a tropical storm as its upper-level circulation became detached from the low-level portion 27 the system deteriorated to a tropical depression as it crossed into southern honduras and at 0900 utc the national hurricane center issued the last advisory on felix as it began degenerating into a broad low pressure area 28 the remnants of felix tracked west-northwestward over other portions of latin america and eventually dissipated over the mexican state of tabasco on september 7. 2 preparations edit hurricane felix in
