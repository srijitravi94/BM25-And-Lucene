islands upon forming the depression had a poorly organized circulation with banding features to its north and east the depression moved west-northwestward and the system failed to organize significantly by a day after developing on september 27, the banding features dissipated though the area of convection around the center increased satellite imagery was unavailable until september 30, during which there were not sufficient ship reports to indicate the presence of a low-level circulation the depression continued west-northwestward and it is estimated it intensified into tropical

to the north bringing it ashore near santa cruz del sur on october 7 with winds of around 90 mph 140 km h  flora initially turned southeastward over central cuba and late on october 8 a short-wave trough turned the hurricane northeastward bringing it into the coastal waters of the holguín province 2 flora remained a hurricane while drifting over land due to abundant moisture and a favorable upper level environment 3 after passing over the southeastern bahamas early on october 9, flora began to restrengthen and on october 10 it again reached major hurricane status while located 290 miles
