cape verde-type category 4 hurricane which caused severe destruction as it traversed the caribbean and gulf of mexico in september 1998, making eight landfalls along its path georges was the seventh tropical storm fourth hurricane and second major hurricane of the 1998 atlantic hurricane season it became the most destructive storm of the season and the costliest atlantic hurricane since hurricane andrew in 1992, and the deadliest since hurricane gordon in 1994. georges killed 604 people mainly on the island of hispaniola and caused extensive damage resulting at just under 10 billion 1998 us

kitts and nevis haiti the dominican republic cuba and the united states and puerto rico a territory of the united states—more than any other hurricane since hurricane inez of the 1966 season meteorological history edit main article meteorological history of hurricane georges map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale a tropical wave exited the coast of africa on september 13. moving westward the large system quickly developed a closed circulation and was classified tropical depression seven on september 15. a strong upper-level ridge forced the depression to the west-northwest where warm water temperatures allowed it to strengthen to a tropical storm on september 16. georges s circulation developed strong banding features around a well-organized central dense overcast and with the aid of a developing anti-cyclone georges attained hurricane status late on september 17. 1 georges near the florida keys conditions became nearly ideal for continued development including warm water temperatures low-level inflow to the hurricane s north and good upper-level outflow a banding eye developed and georges reached major hurricane strength on september 19 while 675 mi 1085 km east-southeast of guadeloupe by september 19, an upper-level anticyclone was well established over georges and satellite pictures suggested that the hurricane was beginning to strengthen rapidly as indicated by the cooling cloud tops increased symmetry of the deep convection and the warming and contracting of the well-defined 40 mi 63 km wide eye as rapid intensification continued and georges peaked at a very dangerous category 4 storm with 155 mph 250 km h wind and a 937 minimal pressure late on september 19 and early september 20. at that time georges was the most intense strongest storm since hurricane hugo and alongside hurricane luis it is one of the largest major hurricanes in the atlantic with hurricane force windfields extending more than 150 mi 250 km from the center and with a more than 300 mi 490 km wide tropical storm force windfield shortly after peaking upper-level wind shear from the development of an upper-level low weakened the hurricane on september 20 in the afternoon as the central pressure had risen 26 mb as georges approached the leeward islands 1 on september 21, after weakening considerably category 3 georges made landfall directly on antigua and three hours later in st kitts though its 175 mi 280 km wide tropical storm force windfield affected all the leeward islands after weakening to a category 2 hurricane over the caribbean upper-level shear decreased and georges strengthened a bit before making landfall near fajardo puerto rico as a 115 mph 175 km h category 3 hurricane early in the morning over the mountainous terrain of the island the hurricane weakened again but over the mona passage it again re-intensified to hit eastern dominican republic with winds of 120 mph 195 km h on september 22. like in puerto rico georges was greatly weakened by the mountainous terrain and after crossing the windward passage it struck 30 mi 48 km east of guantánamo bay cuba on september 23. well-defined upper-level outflow allowed the hurricane to remain well organized and while paralleling the northern coastline of the island georges retained minimal hurricane status 1 hurricane georges reached the straits of florida on september 24, and as it had done earlier in its lifetime quickly restrengthened to category 2 status on the september 25 due to warm water temperatures and little upper-level shear it continued to the west-northwest and struck key west later on september 25 with winds of 105 mph 165 km h  despite moving over warmer water georges only managed to peak at 110 mph 175 km h in the gulf of mexico likely due to its disrupted inner core a mid-tropospheric anticyclone pushed the hurricane slowly north-northwestward forcing georges to make its seventh and final landfall near biloxi mississippi on september 28. within 24 hours georges had weakened to a tropical depression and due to weak steering currents the storm looped over southern mississippi then drifted to the east the weak circulation moved eastward over the interior of the florida panhandle and dissipated on october 1 near the florida georgia border 1 preparations edit lesser antilles edit

46 like in puerto rico and hispaniola the severe drought during the el niño of 1997 exacerbated the flood s disruption to crops in eastern cuba the heavy rainfall from georges damaged the crops greatly despite the effort to harvest them prior to its arrival up to 70 of the plantain crop a chief food in the country s diet was destroyed the sugarcane crop fared badly as well limiting one of the country s important export crops the coffee and cocoa plantations also suffered from the hurricane further damaging the country s food supply 35 well-executed evacuations and warnings limited the
