hurricane on september 11. after striking jamaica the following day rapid intensification occurred once again and the storm became a category 5 hurricane on the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale

plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale the origins of hurricane gilbert trace back to an easterly tropical wave—an elongated low-pressure area moving from east to west—that crossed the northwestern coast of africa on september 3, 1988. over the subsequent days the wave traversed the tropical atlantic and developed a broad wind circulation extending just north of the equator the system remained disorganized until september 8, when satellite images showed a defined circulation center approaching the windward islands the following day the national hurricane center nhc classified it as the twelfth tropical depression of the annual hurricane season using the dvorak technique when it was located about 400 mi 640 km east of barbados the depression proceeded toward the west-northwest and while moving through the lesser antilles near martinique it gained enough strength to be designated as tropical storm gilbert 2 after becoming a tropical storm gilbert underwent a period of significant strengthening passing to the south of hispaniola it became a hurricane late on september 10 and further strengthened to category 3 intensity on the
