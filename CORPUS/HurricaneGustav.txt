of a tropical wave that had previously produced t-rain and squalls in the lesser antilles it developed well-defined curved bands and briefly exhibited an upper-level eye feature the nhc designated it tropical depression seven and dispatched a hurricane hunter aircraft to investigate the system 8 at the time the system had a well-defined outflow in all but the southeast and southwest quadrant 8 9 and data from the hurricane-hunter aircraft confirmed that the tropical depression had strengthened into a tropical storm which was soon designated tropical storm gustav 10 a brief period of disorganization 11 proved to be temporary as a well-defined eye wall formed that same night 12 in the early hours of august 26, as the storm approached haiti s southwestern peninsula 13 another

and the system was not very disrupted when it moved back over water into the gulf of gonâve 21 however the storm s movement slowed and continued interaction with nearby haiti combined with the incursion of mid-level dry air from the northeast resulted in further weakening during the day on august 27. 22 23 the storm began a west-southwesterly movement that brought it closer to jamaica on the morning of august 28 it was found that overnight gustav had either reformed farther to the south or had moved farther to the south than previously thought the storm was also found to have

campaigns against cuba reported about the defection of tv actor yamil jaled the yankee press organization appears to be an allusion to el nuevo herald which broke the news of jaled s arrival in miami
