atlantic hurricane season hurricane hortense was the first hurricane to make landfall in guadeloupe and puerto rico since hurricane hugo in 1989. the eighth tropical cyclone eighth named storm and sixth hurricane of the 1996 atlantic hurricane season hortense developed on september 3 from a tropical wave in the central atlantic ocean initially a tropical depression it headed westward without significant strengthening for four days due to unfavorable upper-level winds while nearing the lesser antilles upper-level winds decreased allowing the depression to become tropical storm hortense on september 7. hortense crossed guadeloupe on september 8 and entered the caribbean sea by on the following day it was upgraded to a hurricane while curving northwestward hortense made landfall in puerto rico on september 9 and brushed the dominican republic shortly thereafter after re-entering the atlantic hortense began to substantially strengthen and peaked as a 140 mph 220 km h category 4 hurricane early on september 13. thereafter the storm steadily weakened as it tracked rapidly north-northeastward early on september 15, hortense made landfall in nova scotia as a minimal category 1 hurricane it quickly weakened further to a tropical storm before re-entering the atlantic to the south of newfoundland late on september 15, hortense transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and subsequently merged with a frontal system about 24 hours later the storm produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds as it passed through the lesser antilles on guadeloupe damage was most significant to crops with over 50 of banana plantains destroyed localized flooding was reported on martinique impact was most significant in puerto rico across the island 11,463 houses were severely damaged about 1.4 million people on puerto rico were left without electricity – equivalent to about 40 of the island s population damage in puerto rico was estimated at 153.4 million 1996 usd  there were also 19 deaths most of which due to drowning during flash floods in the dominican republic strong winds damaged a number of buildings and houses and downed several power lines flooding also forced the closure of several roads and impacted 80 of crops in samaná province at least three fatalities were confirmed in that country the storm brought strong winds to the bahamas and turks and caicos islands and lesser winds to bermuda later in its duration hortense struck nova scotia bringing heavy rainfall and hurricane-force winds to isolated locations there were many power outages trees blown down roofs torn away and roads damaged in the province new brunswick newfoundland and prince edward island were also impacted though not as severely as in nova scotia damage in atlantic canada reached approximately 3.64 million meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale a tropical wave and a broad low-pressure area associated with it exited the west coast of africa near dakar senegal on august 30. the low-pressure area which had deepened to 1,005 mbar 29.7 inhg by august 31, moved south of cape verde although deep convection was minimal on satellite imagery the system possessed a well-defined low- to mid-level circulation after crossing several national oceanic and atmospheric administration buoys early on september 3, it was determined that the system developed into tropical depression eight at 1200 utc on that same day while located about halfway between cape verde and the lesser antilles under the influence of strong high pressure ridge the depression tracked almost due westward without significant intensification convection remained sporadic and disorganized with a reconnaissance flight finding a board circulation and a few squall on september 6. while nearing the leeward islands upper-level winds reduced to a favorable level causing strengthening and allowing deep convection to increase 1 hurricane hortense making landfall in puerto rico on september 10 at 0600 utc on september 7, the depression had intensified into tropical storm hortense a reconnaissance flight around that time reported winds of 71 mph 114 km h  confirming the storm was strengthening early on september 8, hortense struck guadeloupe with winds of 60 mph 95 km h  shortly thereafter intensification slowed due to increased vertical wind shear by upper-level short wave in the eastern caribbean sea convection diminished with satellite imagery showing a tropical cyclone with the low-level circulation exposed the short-wave soon left the area causing wind shear to decrease and convection quickly re-developed by early on september 9, hortense was upgraded to a hurricane while curving northwestward around 0600 utc on the following day the storm made landfall near guánica puerto rico with winds of 80 mph 130 km h 1 this made it the first hurricane landfall on the island since hurricane hugo in 1989. initially most tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated hortense would pass south of the island and instead strike the dominican republic 2 after two hours hortense emerged into the mona passage and brushed the eastern tip of dominican republic punta cana near the eastern tip of the country reported the calm of the eye on september 10. land interaction with hispaniola weakened the storm slightly though it would soon re-strengthen 1 while tracking east of turks and caicos islands on september 11, hortense became a category 2 hurricane and then to a category 3 hurricane by early on the following day continuing to intensify hortense reached category 4 intensity on september 12. around that time a developing trough centered over the eastern united states caused the storm to curve almost due northward and accelerate at 0000 utc on september 13, hortense attained its peak intensity with a maximum sustained wind speed of 140 mph 220 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of 935 mbar 27.6 inhg  after maintaining category 4 intensity for 24 hours the storm weakened back to a category 3 hurricane while passing well east of bermuda hortense was downgraded to a category 2 hurricane early on september 14. later that day the storm weakened further to a category 1 hurricane early on september 15, hortense made its final landfall near west quoddy nova scotia with winds of 75 mph 120 km h  hortense weakened over nova scotia and was a tropical storm when it re-emerged into the atlantic less than nine hours after landfall by 1800 utc on september 15, hortense transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while just south of newfoundland the storm s remnants merged with a frontal system on the following day 1 preparations edit shortly after hortense intensified into a tropical storm a tropical storm warning was issued by the respective governments from martinique to the united states virgin islands late on september 7, about 57 hours before the hurricane s puerto rico landfall a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for puerto rico 1 however the watch was discontinued at 1500 utc on september 8 after the storm experienced increased wind shear in the region 2 at the same time a hurricane warning was left after having been issued for the british and united states virgin islands 12 hours earlier at 1500 utc on september 9 – about fifteen hours before landfall – a hurricane warning was issued in puerto rico 1 the downgrade of the warning on the island led residents to underestimate the hurricane s threat 2 before hortense struck puerto rico the local national weather service office warned of the potential of rainfall exceeding 10 in 250 mm  with higher totals in the mountains 1 late on september 9, a hurricane warning was issued for portions of eastern dominican republic which was eventually extended along the country s northern coastline a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for the north coast of haiti to st nicolas on september 10, a hurricane warning was issued for the turks and caicos islands and for the bahamas islands of inagua and mayaguana a hurricane watch was also issued for the central bahamas 1

62 mph 100 km h in carolina 14 an unofficial wind gust of 109 mph 175 km h in the southwest portion of the island may have been caused by the venturi effect or an acceleration of winds between walls 1 along the southern puerto rico coast hortense caused coastal flooding and beach erosion 14 an overflown river near san juan flooded several homes across the island hortense left about 1.3 million people without power and 1.1 million customers without water during the storm 10,563 people evacuated to storm shelters 14 across the island 11,463 houses were severely damaged by hortense 1 the

drownings 14 some 1,400,000 people about 40 of the population lost power during and after the storm straining the cleanup effort in the following days and weeks with lack of air conditioning and spoiled food 16 flooding in puerto rico while hortense was near the eastern tip of the dominican republic punta cana reported sustained winds of 92 mph 148 km h  which was the highest land wind report associated with the hurricane puerto plata along the northern coast also reported hurricane-force winds high winds destroyed a school and church damaged several houses and downed several power lines like its effects in puerto rico hortense dropped heavy rainfall in the dominican republic peaking at 19.25 in 489 mm in san rafael del yuma while passing the region the hurricane produced a 9 ft 2.7 m
