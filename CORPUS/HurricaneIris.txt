season hurricane iris of 2001 was the most destructive hurricane in belize since hurricane hattie in 1961. iris was the second-strongest storm of the 2001 atlantic hurricane season behind hurricane michelle 1 it was the ninth named storm fifth hurricane and third major hurricane nb 1 of the year forming from a tropical wave on october 4 just southeast of barbados it moved westward through the caribbean intensifying into a tropical storm on october 5 south of puerto rico and into a hurricane the following day while passing south of the dominican republic iris dropped heavy rainfall that caused landslides killing eight people later the hurricane passed south of jamaica where it destroyed two houses on reaching the western caribbean sea iris rapidly intensified into a category 4 on the saffir–simpson scale a small hurricane with an eye of only 7 mi 11 km in diameter iris reached peak winds of 145 mph 230 km h before making landfall in southern belize near monkey river town on october 9. the hurricane quickly dissipated over central america although its remnants contributed to the formation of tropical storm manuel in the eastern pacific ocean destruction was heaviest in belize and totaled 250 million 2001 usd  nb 2 because iris was compact the damage was largely confined to 72 of the houses in the toledo district and 50 of the houses in the stann creek district the hurricane damaged or destroyed 3,718 homes nationwide and wrecked more than 95 of the homes in 35 villages in the poorest parts of the country iris left about 15,000 people homeless many receiving assistance from the government and the local red cross chapter high winds also damaged large swaths of forest and crops mostly affecting the banana industry iris killed 24 people in belize including 20 who died when a scuba diving boat capsized near big creek the storm also killed eight people and damaged about 2,500 homes in neighboring guatemala and later dropped heavy rainfall in southern mexico where two people died meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale toward the end of september 2001, a poorly defined tropical wave moved westward across the tropical atlantic ocean through an area of hostile wind shear which was caused by a large upper-level low within a trough to the northeast of the lesser antilles 3 a few days later the upper-level low detached from the trough and moved southwestward over the caribbean sea allowing for an upper-level ridge or high-pressure area to form over the tropical wave the change provided a favorable environment for tropical development and an area of convection soon blossomed along the wave s axis as the tropical wave approached the lesser antilles a mid-level wind circulation formed within the deepest part of the convection and a low-level circulation became gradually more pronounced on satellite imagery although its low-level circulation was small and poorly defined the system increased in organization enough to be classified as tropical depression eleven at 12 00 utc on october 4, located about 100 mi 160 km southeast of barbados 3 operationally however hurricane hunters did not confirm the depression s formation until nine hours later 4 in its early stages the depression moved west-northwestward between the islands of st vincent and st lucia under the influence of a strong ridge to its north compared to its appearance 24 hours before forming the depression exhibited improved outflow and more distinct convection although its lower circulation remained very poorly organized 4 this was confirmed by a hurricane hunters flight into the system which failed to report a closed circulation despite the depression s well-organized appearance on satellite imagery 5 at 21 00 utc on october 5, they reported a strengthening circulation with flight-level winds of 74 mph 119 km h  corresponding to a surface wind intensity of 60 mph 95 km h  based on these data the depression was upgraded to tropical storm iris situated about 155 mi 250 km south of the southern coast of puerto rico 6 in post-season analysis the national hurricane center nhc estimated that iris had attained tropical storm status about nine hours earlier 3 hurricane iris in the western caribbean sea on october 8 despite the storm s intensification and well-organized satellite appearance the circulation failed to become better defined 3 in their first discussion on iris the nhc mentioned the potential for the system to degenerate into a tropical wave if it maintained its fast forward speed 4 one forecaster noted that the center was fragile and that the cyclone could dissipate quickly if it encountered stronger wind shear to its south 6 although its overall appearance did not change significantly the hurricane hunters reported a closed eye with a diameter 23 mi 37 km and a stadium effect eyewall curvature on october 6. 7 later that day iris reached hurricane strength just southwest of the southern tip of the dominican republic 3 and the nhc remarked that land interaction with the greater antilles was the only factor impeding further development 8 after iris reached winds of 85 mph 140 km h early on october 7, its intensity remained steady for about 24 hours 3 during that time the satellite appearance became slightly ragged as its outflow became restricted possibly due to an upper-level low 9 by late on october 7, the area of hurricane force winds associated with iris extended only 25 mi 35 km from its 16 mi 22 km wide eye 10 11 early on october 8, after turning west-southwestward away from the greater antilles iris began strengthening again with warm waters and an absence of significant wind shear the nhc predicted peak winds of 105 mph 165 km h before the storm would hit belize 12 it rapidly intensified with the favorable conditions intensifying from 95 mph 150 km h to 140 mph 225 km h in a 12-hour period on october 8, making iris a category 4 hurricane on the saffir-simpson scale in the same duration the minimum central pressure dropped 38 mbar 1.12 inhg  3 while intensifying the hurricane developed concentric eyewalls with an innermost eye having a diameter of 7 mi 11 km  13 for comparison the smallest known eye diameter on record for an atlantic hurricane was about 3 mi 5 km  during hurricane wilma in 2005. 14 with such a small eye a hurricane hunters flight could not deploy a dropsonde into the center of iris 13 and shortly after the flight the innermost eye collapsed as the core paralleled the honduras coastline just offshore this resulted in a temporary and slight weakening during an eyewall replacement cycle but within a few hours iris re-intensified to attain peak winds of 145 mph 230 km h just off belize at 02 00 utc on october 9, it made landfall at peak intensity in monkey river town in the southern portion of belize 3 initially hurricane iris was forecast to remain a tropical cyclone while crossing central america and to re-intensify in the eastern pacific ocean had it done so it would have retained the name iris 13 instead the hurricane rapidly weakened after moving into the mountainous terrain of guatemala and within six hours of landfall the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm late on october 9, within sixteen hours of landfall the circulation dissipated over extreme southeastern mexico 3 as the remnants approached the pacific ocean a new area of convection developed south of the original circulation of iris it gradually organized while continuing westward developing into tropical storm manuel the new storm ultimately lasted until october 18 before succumbing to cooler waters and wind shear 15 preparations edit over a stretch of four days sixteen tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued in association with iris affecting the dominican republic the cuban provinces of granma and santiago de cuba jamaica cayman islands the yucatán peninsula guatemala honduras and belize 3 the threat from iris prompted the jamaica national emergency operations center to be activated shelters were opened in the country but were ultimately unused 16 in belize a hurricane warning was issued about 23 hours before iris moved ashore 3 a state of national emergency was declared on october 8 as hurricane iris neared landfall all emergency response committees were activated to quickly begin recovery efforts 17 a mandatory evacuation was issued for stann creek and toledo coastal villages and all offshore islands the main hospital in belize city was evacuated as a precaution and the city itself was placed under a voluntary evacuation order 18 overall 11,380 people evacuated their homes in belize 19 including many in belize city 20 these evacuations were later credited for limiting the death toll 21 hurricane keith had struck the nation a year prior preparing some citizens for what to expect 20 disaster response teams arrived the day after iris was projected to make landfall pan american health organization staff were on standby in belize guatemala and honduras and were ready to respond to any post-storm disease outbreaks 18 on october 8, the government of honduras declared a red alert for all northern regions advising residents to expect extreme weather conditions  22 about 5,000 people in the country evacuated from their homes to the north of belize officials in mexico evacuated people from fishing villages and closed ports 23 impact edit death toll by area state country deaths belize 23 dominican republic 3 guatemala 8 mexico 2 total 36 lesser and greater antilles edit while iris was in its development stages residents as far north as saint thomas reported rain and thunderstorms 24 in the dominican republic iris dropped around 3 in 76 mm of rainfall along the coast forcing 35 families to evacuate their homes after rivers exceeded their banks the rains triggered a landslide outside of santo domingo that destroyed a home killing a family of three there was another landslide in the region that injured two people 25 iris s passage near jamaica destroyed two houses and damaged the roofs of two others causing one injury otherwise damage in the country was minimal 16 offshore edit a 120 ft 37 m scuba diving boat overturned during the hurricane near big creek belize possibly hit by a tornado 26 the boat named the wave dancer had 28 people on board 3 including 20 from the richmond dive club out of richmond virginia most of them were upstairs in the boat and none were diving the captain had delayed returning to shore and the passengers waited for the storm to pass along a dock not anticipating the ferocity 27 iris cut the ropes connecting the boat to the dock causing it to overturn in 12 ft 3.7 m waters 26 27 eight people survived and 11 bodies were recovered it was presumed that 20 people died during the wreck 3 including 15 from the richmond area and

the highest measured winds were 106 mph 171 km h at a station in big creek because of its small diameter iris produced heavy damage only in a 70 mi 110 km area of southern belize in that region the hurricane produced a storm surge of up to 15 ft 4.6 m  3 with waves of over 13 ft 4.0 m in height 21 causing street flooding and some damage to the offshore cayes 35 as it moved ashore iris damaged houses and schools in dozens of villages 36 in 35 villages the storm destroyed more than 95 of the buildings 37 its small size confined the worst damage largely to toledo and stann creek districts which are the two southernmost and poorest districts of the country 21 38 the percentage of damaged houses was 72 in toledo district and about 50 in stann creek 39 leaving about 15,000 people homeless 40 in both districts the storm caused power outages and contaminated water supplies 37 in the worst-affected areas poor mayan people living on farms lost much of what they owned 37 at placencia near the coast about 80 of the homes were destroyed and many of the remaining buildings had roof damage with downed power poles in the streets 21 about 90 of the houses in nearby seine bight were destroyed 41 and where iris made landfall over 90 of the homes were destroyed throughout monkey river town 21 the storm damaged several roads and fishing piers in southern belize iris also damaged tourism facilities including minor impact to the maya ruins of belize 42 and damaged 20 of the hotel rooms in the country accounting for 37 million in losses 43 the remainder of the country remained generally unaffected during the storm 44 in southern belize the storm s strong winds left crop damage in some cases where the harvest had just begun about 5,000 acres 2,000 ha of bananas were destroyed along with over 3,500 acres 1,400 ha of rice 3,000 acres 1,200 ha of corn and other crops to a lesser degree 42 the storm also flooded fields and killed several livestock the shrimp industry lost 25 of its catch 42 partly due to contaminated waters 45 crop damage in belize was estimated at 103 million 43 mostly from banana losses 42 iris s strong winds also damaged large swaths of forest with upwards of 40 of trees affected in some areas 42 this disrupted the habitats of several animals and it is likely that many of the howler monkeys near monkey river were killed 46 the storm s strong waves eroded the beach although marine effects were much less than those of hurricane keith in the previous year 42 nevertheless there were reports of fish die-offs after the storm possibly from low oxygen due to too much decaying matter 46 nationwide iris damaged or destroyed 3,718 homes 47 directly affecting a total of 21,568 people 38 or 8.5 of the total population 48 the storm damaged or destroyed 31 schools and 17 health facilities 38 along with 21 government buildings 49 there was about 25 million in damage to the transportation sector including highways and bridges 43 iris killed 24 people in and around the country 50 including the victims of the wave dancer shipwreck 51 overall damage was estimated at 250 million 52 making it the most damaging storm in the country since hurricane hattie in 1961. 44 elsewhere in central america edit high tides and heavy rainfall caused power outages across both guatemala and honduras 20 in the former the hurricane s rainfall generally amounted to 3 to 4 in 76 to 102 mm  triggering flash flooding and landslides that injured nearly 100 people 53 the damage was heaviest in petén department in the northern portion of the country 54 the storm damaged 26 schools and 2,500 homes in the country s interior 55 56 an estimated 27,500 people were affected by the storm throughout guatemala 53 there were eight deaths in the country 3 two of them the result of falling trees 57 the remnants of iris dropped heavy rainfall over southern mexico accumulating 4.80 in 122 mm in the southern state of chiapas 58 in oaxaca the storm produced heavy rains and damaged a total of 120 houses a mudslide in one village demolished 20 homes and killed a child while elsewhere in the state a man drowned after being swept away in a flooded river 59 aftermath edit on october 9, the government of belize issued the all clear signal indicating that the storm had fully passed and began reconstruction efforts and damage assessment 60 the government declared stann creek and toledo districts as disaster areas 45 and officials declared a nighttime curfew by the day after the storm struck the airport in belize city had been reopened and transportation in all but the southern portion of the country returned to normal 41 residents in the southern part of the country lost access to fresh water forcing them to drink unclean water 37 officials sent medical teams to southern belize in the most affected areas 21 the belmopan red cross issued an appeal for residents to donate money clothing and food for storm victims 41 the red cross also set up shelters and gave food to more than 7,000 people 51 by october 19, most roads in southern belize were reopened the belize government printed a new postage stamp to help pay for reconstruction costs and officials authorized spending 1.2 million to rebuild damaged homes to assist the farmers who lost crops the belize government provided 18,000 lb 8,200 kg of maize seeds as well as fertilizer 39 after the storm the world food programme and the belize red cross collectively provided food for the 9,000 families in need of subsidence 61 by october 31, the red cross had provided blankets tarps and hygienic supplies to 4,800 people severely affected by the storm 62 homes were gradually repaired and crop production returned to normal by early 2002. around christmas of 2001, the belize red cross provided presents to school children in 14 villages affected by the storm 47 the lost banana crop caused sales to decrease by 22 in 2002, although sales gradually recovered 63 the government of belize issued an appeal to the international community for assistance in the days following iris s landfall 64 and various countries provided aid 41 the united kingdom sent a helicopter to assist in damage assessment and a crew to clean the water the united states also sent a crew for damage assessment and donated plastic sheeting 65 although sustaining significant damage the government of guatemala deployed a working team with members from throughout the country to assist in recovery in belize 66 mexico sent blankets mattresses food and water as well as a medical team 65 the japanese government sent tents and blankets 67 and the chinese government donated 500 lb 230 kg of rice and dried fruits 65 various united nations departments donated about 225,000. 41 the american victims of the wave dancer boat wreck were flown back to the richmond virginia area following the storm 26 the insurance company covering the boat reached a 4 million settlement which was disbursed among the survivors and the victims families the boat operator remained in business following the accident 27 following the major damage in belize the name iris was retired in the spring of 2002 by the world meteorological organization and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane the name was subsequently replaced by the name ingrid and was first used during the 2007 season 68
