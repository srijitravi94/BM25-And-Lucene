verde-type hurricane the strongest observed in the atlantic since wilma in 2005 in terms of maximum sustained winds it was the first category 5 hurricane to strike the leeward islands on record and the costliest caribbean hurricane 1 until hurricane maria only two weeks later it was also the most intense atlantic hurricane to strike the united states since katrina in 2005, and the first major hurricane to make landfall in florida since wilma in 2005. the ninth named storm fourth hurricane second major hurricane and first category 5 hurricane of the 2017 atlantic hurricane season irma

islands from a tropical wave that had moved off the west african coast three days prior 2 3 4 under favorable conditions irma rapidly intensified shortly after formation becoming a category 2 hurricane on the saffir–simpson scale within a mere 24 hours irma became a category 3 hurricane and therefore a major hurricane shortly afterward however the intensity fluctuated between categories 2 and 3 for the next several days due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles on september 4, irma resumed intensifying becoming a category 5 hurricane by early the next day on september 6, irma reached its peak intensity with 185 mph 295 km h winds and a minimum pressure of 914 hpa 27.0 inhg  making it the second most intense tropical cyclone worldwide so far in 2017, behind only hurricane maria and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed another eyewall replacement cycle caused irma to weaken back to a category 4 hurricane but the storm attained category 5 status for a second time before making landfall in cuba after dropping to category 3 intensity due to land interaction the storm re-intensified to category 4 status as it crossed warm waters between cuba and florida before making landfall on cudjoe key with maximum sustained winds at 130 mph 215 km h  irma dropped back to category 3 by the time it made a second florida landfall on marco island irma

in the contiguous united states four in the u.s virgin islands and two others in unknown locations in the caribbean meteorological history map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale the national hurricane center nhc began monitoring a tropical wave over western africa on august 26. 7 this wave moved off the coast of the continent late on august 27. throughout the next two days showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low pressure area as the system passed just south of and then through the cape verde islands on august 29, 8 with the nhc stating that any significant organization of the disturbance would result in the classification of a tropical depression 9 further organization over the next 24 hours or so led to classification of the disturbance as tropical storm irma at 15 00 utc on august 30, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates 10 with warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear strengthening was anticipated with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air a viirs satellite image of hurricane irma on september 3 the nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow as an anticyclone became established over the system with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images 11 early on

weaken later on the same day irma s remnants began interacting with a cold front stretching over newfoundland 29 on september 16, irma s remnant circulation collapsed and the majority of irma s remnant moisture was absorbed into hurricane jose later that day 30 data collected by nasa showed that ocean surface temperatures in the path of irma were above 30 °c 86 °f at the time more than enough to sustain a category 5 hurricane 31 additionally ocean surface temperatures in areas along the strait of florida extended to 32 °c 90 °f  32 33 which could support a maximum potential intensity of 200 miles per hour 320 km h  if ideal conditions had been met 34 preparations caribbean given that irma s forecast track was along much of the caribbean island chain hurricane warnings
