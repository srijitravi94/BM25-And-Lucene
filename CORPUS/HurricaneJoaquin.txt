of the 2015 atlantic hurricane season hurricane joaquin spanish pronunciation xwaˈkin wah-keen 1 was a powerful tropical cyclone that devastated several districts of the bahamas and caused damage in the turks and caicos islands parts of the greater antilles and bermuda it was also the strongest atlantic hurricane of non-tropical origin in the satellite era 2 3 the tenth named storm third hurricane and second major hurricane of the 2015 atlantic hurricane season joaquin evolved from a non-tropical low to become a tropical depression on september 28, well southwest of bermuda tempered by unfavorable wind shear the depression drifted southwestward after becoming a tropical storm the next day joaquin underwent rapid intensification reaching hurricane status on september 30 and category 4 major hurricane strength on october 1. meandering over the southern bahamas joaquin s eye passed near or over several islands on october 3, the hurricane weakened somewhat and accelerated to the northeast abrupt re-intensification ensued later that day and joaquin acquired sustained winds of 155 mph 250 km h  just short of category 5 strength hurricane warnings were hoisted across most of the bahamas as the hurricane threatened the country battering the nation s southern islands for over two days joaquin caused extensive devastation most notably on acklins crooked island long island rum cay and san salvador island severe storm surge inundated many communities trapping hundreds of people in their homes flooding persisted for days after the hurricane s departure prolonged intense winds brought down trees and powerlines and unroofed homes throughout the affected region as airstrips were submerged and heavily damaged relief workers were limited in their ability to quickly help residents affected by joaquin one of the strongest storms on record to affect the nation offshore the american cargo ship el faro and her 33 members were lost to the hurricane coastal flooding also impacted the nearby turks and caicos washing out roadways compromising seawalls and damaging homes strong winds and heavy rainfall caused some property damage in eastern cuba one fisherman died when heavy seas capsized a small boat along the coast of haiti storm tides resulted in severe flooding in several departments of haiti forcing families from their homes and destroying crops the weakening hurricane passed just west of bermuda on october 4, attended by strong winds that cut power to 15,000 electric subscribers but caused only minor damage otherwise after passing near bermuda joaquin ultimately curved northeastward and accelerated weakening further and becoming extratropical as it entered colder waters collectively joaquin killed 34 people and caused 200 million usd in damages with all 34 deaths attributed to the storm occurring at sea joaquin has the highest offshore death toll for any atlantic hurricane since the escuminac hurricane in 1959, which killed 35 people in the northumberland strait 4 although joaquin never directly affected the united states another large storm system over the southeastern states drew tremendous moisture from the hurricane resulting in catastrophic flooding in south carolina meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale on september 25, 2015, the us national hurricane center nhc began monitoring an upper-level low accompanied by a surface trough several hundred miles south-southwest of bermuda for possible tropical cyclogenesis 5 the system gradually consolidated as it drifted north-northwest acquiring a closed surface low late on september 26. 6 convective showers and thunderstorms steadily increased on september 27, and at 03 00 utc on september 28 the nhc assessed the system to have become a tropical depression situated roughly 405 mi 650 km southwest of bermuda 7 8 9 although the depression featured a well-defined low strong wind shear displaced convection and exposed the circulation a ridge to the north was forecast to steer the system slowly northwest into a region of higher shear meteorologists at the nhc initially depicted the system dissipating within 96 hours based on modeling depictions 8 convection developed and persisted closer to the circulation centre throughout september 28, 10 and early on september 29 dvorak satellite classifications indicated the system became a tropical storm accordingly it was assigned the name joaquin becoming the tenth named storm of the season 11 12 hurricane joaquin meandering around the bahamas on october 2. note the system to its north which produced heavy rainfall over the carolinas strengthening of the mid-level ridge prompted a sudden shift in joaquin s trajectory to the southwest directing it towards the bahamas 11 13 forecasters at the nhc noted considerable uncertainty in the future of joaquin with forecast models depicting a wide range of possibilities 14 throughout september 29 the storm steadily intensified as its circulation became embedded within deep convection and upper-level outflow became increasingly prominent 15 high sea surface temperatures and decreasing shear aided strengthening and early on september 30 the storm achieved hurricane status 16 17 rapid intensification ensued thereafter with an eye developing within a symmetric central dense overcast data from aircraft reconnaissance indicated that joaquin reached category 3 status on the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale by 03 00 utc on october 1. 18 around 12 00 utc the eye of joaquin passed over samana cay bahamas with winds of 130 mph 215 km h  making it a category 4 hurricane 19 around this same time its eye contracted from 41 to 27 mi 66 to 43 km in diameter representing significant intensification 20 21 at this time joaquin was located just 15 mi 25 km northwest of crooked island 22 the storm s central pressure bottomed out at 931 mbar hpa 27.49 inhg around 00 00 utc on october 2. 23 as the ridge previously steering joaquin southwest began retreating north the hurricane s movement slowed and shifted west and later north early on october 2. 24 25 an eyewall replacement cycle—a process whereby a second larger eye develops while the inner eye collapses—began that morning 26 its eye became increasingly ill-defined in satellite imagery 25 slight weakening took place accordingly 27 and the hurricane passed over rum cay and san salvador island around 16 00 utc and 21 00 utc as a strong category 3 hurricane with winds of 125 mph 205 km h 19 a pressure near 944 mbar hpa 27.88 inhg was observed on san salvador island 28 an amplifying trough over the southeastern united states enhanced southwesterly flow over joaquin on october 3 and prompted the hurricane to accelerate northeast away from the bahamas 29 throughout the day the storm s eye became increasingly defined and re-intensification ensued 30 aircraft reconnaissance found a considerably stronger system that afternoon based on flight-level winds of 166 mph 267 km h  it is estimated that joaquin attained surface winds of 155 mph 250 km h —a high-end category 4 hurricane—by 16 00 utc 31 this made joaquin the strongest atlantic hurricane of non-tropical origin in the satellite era 19 goes satellite animation of hurricane joaquin from september 28 to october 7 shortly after peaking the hurricane s overall structure began to deteriorate signalling a weakening trend 32 on october 4 the storm curved towards the north-northeast between a large low pressure system to its west and a mid-level ridge to its east 33 as deep convection over its core continued to wane 34 joaquin passed about 70 mi 110 km west-northwest of bermuda near 00 00 utc on october 5, with winds of 85 mph 140 km h  19 the weakening trend slowed that day as the storm s satellite presentation improved slightly marked by brief reappearances of a distinct eye feature joaquin gradually turned northeastward around the periphery of the weak ridge and subsequently accelerated toward the east-northeast as it entered the prevailing westerlies 35 the system maintained hurricane intensity until 15 00 utc on october 7, by which point strengthening wind shear and an increasingly colder environment began to take their toll 36 the cloud pattern became lopsided as colder drier air infiltrated the circulation forming the first stages of a frontal structure 37 with its extratropical transition well underway joaquin lost its identity as a tropical cyclone at 03 00 utc on october 8, about 850 mi 1,370 km southeast of cape race newfoundland 38 during the next several days joaquin s extratropical remnant continued heading eastward across the atlantic before reaching portugal on october 10. 39 during the next 5 days joaquin s remnant slowly moved southward along the coast of portugal until the system was absorbed by another frontal system to the east of spain on october 15. 40 preparations

87 initial claims of numerous casualties throughout the island chain proved unsubstantiated 72 and although one man died during the storm on long island his death was unrelated to the hurricane 88 in the aftermath of the hurricane one person was reported missing on ragged island which escaped with relatively minor effects 74 78 initial analysis determined that joaquin resulted in 120.6 million in damage however one year later it was revealed that the storm actually caused 200 million in damage across the bahamian archepeligo 89 90 due to low insurance penetration insured losses were expected to account for no more than half of that total 91 airports in the hardest-hit districts were damaged flooded and carpeted in debris 74 forcing storm victims to rely on helicopters seaplanes and

officials to close part of the road multiple homes along the coast faced flooding and leaking roofs in several areas pounding surf brought about coastal erosion and deposited large volumes of seaweed providenciales international airport remained closed for two days while its storm-damaged weather station awaited replacement additionally the territory lost fruit and vegetable crops to the storm especially at the government farm on north caicos 127 although joaquin ultimately tracked far to the east of the united states a non-tropical low over the southeast tapped into the hurricane s moisture an atmospheric river developed between the two systems resulting in record-shattering rains and flooding across north and south carolina several areas of south carolina saw accumulations exceeding the threshold for a 1-in-1,000-year event the subsequent floods inundated large areas of the state—with areas around charleston and columbia hardest-hit—and killed 19 people 128 129 retirement edit see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names on april 25, 2016, it was announced by the world meteorological organization that the name joaquin would be retired due to the severe
