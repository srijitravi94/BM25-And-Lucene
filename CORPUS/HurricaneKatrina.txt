hurricane katrina at wikimedia commons news related to katrina stories at wikinews works related to katrina sources at wikisource v t e hurricane katrina was an extremely destructive and deadly tropical cyclone that was one of the costliest natural disasters and one of the five deadliest hurricanes in the history of the united states 2 it also was the costliest us disaster until 2017, when hurricane harvey hit the united states gulf coast it was the eleventh named storm the fifth hurricane and the third major hurricane of the record-breaking 2005 atlantic hurricane season the storm originated over the bahamas on august 23 from the interaction between a tropical wave and the remnants of tropical depression ten early the following day the new depression intensified into tropical storm katrina the cyclone headed generally westward toward florida and strengthened into a hurricane only two hours before making landfall at hallandale beach and aventura on august 25. after very briefly weakening to a tropical storm katrina emerged into the gulf of mexico on august 26 and began to rapidly deepen the storm strengthened to a category 5 hurricane over the warm waters of the gulf of mexico 3 but weakened before making its second landfall as a category 3 hurricane on august 29, in southeast louisiana the storm caused severe destruction along the gulf coast from central florida to texas much of it due to the storm surge and levee failure severe property damage occurred in coastal areas such as mississippi beachfront towns where boats and casino barges rammed buildings pushing cars and houses inland water reached 6–12 miles 10–19 km from the beach the storm was the third most intense united states landfalling tropical cyclone behind the 1935 labor day hurricane and hurricane camille in 1969. overall at least 1,245 people died in the hurricane and subsequent floods making it the deadliest united states hurricane since the 1928 okeechobee hurricane total property damage was estimated at 108 billion 2005 usd  1 roughly four times the damage wrought by hurricane andrew in 1992 in the united states 4 over fifty breaches in new orleans s hurricane surge protection were the cause of the majority of the death and destruction during katrina on august 29, 2005. eventually 80 of the city and large tracts of neighboring parishes became flooded and the floodwaters lingered for weeks 5 according to a modeling exercise conducted by the u.s army corps of engineers usace  two-thirds of the deaths in greater new orleans were due to levee and floodwall failure 6 all of the major studies concluded that the usace the designers and builders of the levee system as mandated by the flood control act of 1965, was responsible this is mainly due to a decision to use shorter steel sheet pilings in an effort to save money 7 in january 2008, judge stanwood duval u.s district court ruled that despite the corps role in the flooding the agency 8 could not be held financially liable because of sovereign immunity in the flood control act of 1928. exactly ten years after katrina j david rogers lead author of a new report in the official journal of the world water council concluded that the flooding during katrina could have been prevented had the corps retained an external review board to double-check its flood-wall designs 9 10 there was also an investigation of the responses from federal state and local governments resulting in the resignation of federal emergency management agency fema director michael d brown and of new orleans police department nopd superintendent eddie compass many other government officials were criticized for their responses especially new orleans mayor ray nagin louisiana governor kathleen blanco and president george w bush several agencies including the united states coast guard uscg  national hurricane center nhc  and national weather service nws were commended for their actions the nhc provided accurate hurricane forecasts with sufficient lead time 11 meteorological history main article meteorological history of hurricane katrina map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale hurricane katrina formed as tropical depression twelve over the southeastern bahamas on august 23, 2005, as the result of an interaction between a tropical wave and the remnants of tropical depression ten the storm strengthened into tropical storm katrina on the morning of august 24. the tropical storm moved towards florida and became a hurricane only two hours before making landfall between hallandale beach and aventura on the morning of august 25. the storm weakened over land but it regained hurricane status about one hour after entering the gulf of mexico and it continued strengthening over open waters on august 27, the storm reached category 3 intensity on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale becoming the third major hurricane of the season an eyewall replacement cycle disrupted the intensification but caused the storm to nearly double in size 1 the storm rapidly intensified after entering the gulf growing from a category 3 hurricane to a category 5 hurricane in just nine hours this rapid growth was due to the storm s movement over the unusually warm waters of the loop current 12 katrina on august 28, nearing the gulf coast katrina attained category 5 status on the morning of august 28 and reached its peak strength at 1800 utc that day with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph 280 km h and a minimum central pressure of 902 mbar 26.6 inhg  the pressure measurement made katrina the fourth most intense atlantic hurricane on record at the time only to be surpassed by hurricanes rita and wilma later in the season it was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the gulf of mexico at the time however this record was later broken by hurricane rita 1 the hurricane subsequently weakened and katrina made its second landfall at 1110 utc on august 29 as a category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 125 mph 200 km h near buras-triumph louisiana at landfall hurricane-force winds extended outward 120 miles 190 km from the center and the storm s central pressure was 920 mbar 27 inhg  after moving over southeastern louisiana and breton sound it made its third landfall near the louisiana–mississippi border with 120 mph 190 km h sustained winds still at category 3 intensity 13 katrina maintained strength well into mississippi finally losing hurricane strength more than 150 miles 240 km inland near meridian mississippi it was downgraded to a tropical depression near clarksville tennessee but its remnants were last distinguishable in the eastern great lakes region on august 31, when it was absorbed by a frontal boundary the resulting extratropical storm moved rapidly to the northeast and affected eastern canada 1 preparations main article preparations for hurricane katrina federal government flanked by michael chertoff secretary of homeland security left and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld president george w bush meets with members of the white house task force on hurricane katrina recovery on august 31, 2005, in the cabinet room of the white house the united states coast guard began pre-positioning resources in a ring around the expected impact zone and activated more than 400 reservists on august 27, it moved its personnel out of the new orleans region prior to the mandatory evacuation 14 aircrews from the aviation training center in mobile staged rescue aircraft from texas to florida 15 all aircraft were returning towards the gulf of mexico by the afternoon of august 29. air crews many of whom lost their homes during the hurricane began a round-the-clock rescue effort in new orleans and along the mississippi and alabama coastlines 16 president of the united states george w bush declared a state of emergency in selected regions of louisiana alabama and mississippi on august 27. 17 on sunday august 28, president bush spoke with governor blanco to encourage her to order a mandatory evacuation of new orleans 18 however during the testimony by former federal emergency management agency fema chief michael brown before a u.s house subcommittee on september 26, representative stephen buyer r-in inquired as to why president bush s declaration of state of emergency of august 27 had not included the coastal parishes of orleans jefferson and plaquemines 19 the declaration actually did not include any of louisiana s coastal parishes whereas the coastal counties were included in the declarations for mississippi and alabama 20 21 brown testified that this was because louisiana governor blanco had not included those parishes in her initial request for aid a decision that he found shocking after the hearing blanco released a copy of her letter which showed she had requested assistance for all the southeastern parishes including the city of new orleans as well specifically naming 14 parishes including jefferson orleans st bernard and plaquemines 22 voluntary and mandatory evacuations were issued for large areas of southeast louisiana as well as coastal mississippi and alabama about 1.2 million residents of the gulf coast were covered under a voluntary or mandatory evacuation order 1 national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa on the afternoon of august 26, the national hurricane center nhc realized that katrina had yet to make the turn toward the florida panhandle and ended up revising the predicted track of the storm from the panhandle to the mississippi coast 23 the national weather service s new orleans baton rouge office issued a vividly worded bulletin on august 28 predicting that the area would be uninhabitable for weeks after devastating damage caused by katrina which at that time rivaled the intensity of hurricane camille 24 during video conferences involving the president later that day and on august 29, nhc director max mayfield expressed concern that katrina might push its storm surge over the city s levees and flood walls in one conference he stated i do not think anyone can tell you with confidence right now whether the levees will be topped or not but that s obviously a very very great concern 25 additionally the national hurricane center issued many tropical cyclone warnings and watches throughout the

counties schools were closed and a shelter was opened in immokalee 31 radar loop of hurricane katrina making landfall in louisiana on august 28, alabama governor bob riley declared a state of emergency for the approaching hurricane katrina on the same day he requested president bush to declare expedited major disaster declaration for six counties of south alabama which was quickly approved three-hundred and fifty national guardsmen were called on duty by august 30. 32 the state of mississippi activated its national guard on august 26 in preparation for the storm s landfall additionally the state government activated its emergency operations center the next day and local governments began issuing evacuation orders by 6 00 pm cdt on august 28, 11 counties and cities issued evacuation orders a number which increased to 41 counties and 61 cities by the following morning moreover 57 emergency shelters were established on coastal communities with 31 additional shelters available to open if needed 11 by sunday august 28, most infrastructure along the gulf coast had been shut down including all freight and amtrak rail traffic into the evacuation areas as well as the waterford nuclear generating station 33 louisiana see also hurricane preparedness for new orleans vertical cross-section of new orleans showing maximum levee height of 23 feet 7 m  vertical scale exaggerated in louisiana the state s hurricane evacuation plan calls for local governments in areas along and near the coast to evacuate in three phases starting with the immediate coast 50 hours before the start of tropical storm force winds persons in areas designated phase ii begin evacuating 40 hours before the onset of tropical storm winds and those in phase iii areas including new orleans evacuate 30 hours before the start of such winds 34 many private caregiving facilities that relied on bus companies and ambulance services for evacuation were unable to evacuate their charges because they waited too long 35 louisiana s emergency operations plan supplement 1c part ii section ii paragraph d calls for use of school and other public buses in evacuations 36 although buses that later flooded were available to transport those dependent upon public transportation not enough bus drivers were available to drive them as governor blanco did not sign an emergency waiver to allow any licensed driver to transport evacuees on school buses 37 by august 26, the possibility of unprecedented cataclysm was already being considered many of the computer models had shifted the potential path of katrina 150 miles 240 km westward from the florida panhandle putting the city of new orleans directly in the center of their track probabilities the chances of a direct hit were forecast at 17  with strike probability rising to 29 by august 28. 38 this scenario was considered a potential catastrophe because some parts of new orleans and the metro area are below sea level since the storm surge produced by the hurricane s right-front quadrant containing the strongest winds was forecast to be 28 feet 8.5 m  while the levees offered protection to 23 feet 7.0 m  emergency management officials in new orleans feared that the storm surge could go over the tops of levees protecting the city causing major flooding 39 at a news conference at 10 am on august 28, shortly after katrina was upgraded to a category 5 storm new orleans mayor ray nagin ordered the first-ever mandatory evacuation of the city calling katrina a storm that most of us have long feared 40 the city government also established several refuges of last resort for citizens who could not leave the city including the massive louisiana superdome which sheltered approximately 26,000 people and provided them with food and water for several days as the storm came ashore 41 42 some estimates claimed that 80 of the 1.3 million residents of the greater new orleans metropolitan area evacuated leaving behind substantially fewer people

surge caused 53 breaches to various flood protection structures in and around the greater new orleans area submerging 80 of the city a june 2007 report by the american society of civil engineers indicated that two-thirds of the flooding was caused by the multiple failures of the city s floodwalls 47 the storm surge also devastated the coasts of mississippi and alabama making katrina the most destructive and costliest natural disaster in the history of the united states and the deadliest hurricane since the 1928 okeechobee hurricane the total damage from katrina is estimated at 108 billion 2005 u.s dollars  1 48 the death toll from katrina is uncertain with reports differing by hundreds according to the national hurricane center 1,836 fatalities can be attributed to the storm 1 in kentucky 2 each in alabama georgia and ohio 14 in florida 238 in mississippi and 1,577 in louisiana 44 49 however 135 people remain categorized as missing in louisiana 49 and many of the deaths are indirect but it is almost impossible to determine the exact cause of some of the fatalities 1 a 2008 report by the disaster medicine and public health preparedness journal indicates that 966 deaths can be directly attributed to the storm in louisiana including out of state evacuees and another 20 indirectly such as firearm related deaths and gas poisoning  due to uncertain causes of death with 454 evacuees an upper-bound of 1,440 is noted in the paper 45 a follow-up study by the louisiana department of health hospitals determined that the storm was directly responsible for 1,170 fatalities

the storm dropped heavy rainfall in portions of the miami metropolitan area with a peak total of 16.43 in 417 mm in perrine as a result local flooding occurred in miami-dade county damaging approximately 100 homes farther south in the florida keys a tornado was spawned in marathon on august 26. the tornado damaged a hangar at the airport there and caused an estimated 5 million in damage 52 the rains caused flooding and the combination of rains and winds downed trees and power lines leaving 1.45 million people without power damage in south florida was estimated at 523 million mostly as a result of crop damage twelve deaths occurred in south florida of which three were caused by downed trees in broward county three from drowning in miami-dade county three were from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by generators one was due to a vehicle accident one occurred during debris cleanup and one was associated with a lack of electricity significant impact was also reported in the florida panhandle although katrina moved ashore in louisiana and mississippi its outer periphery produced a 5.37 ft 1.64 m storm surge in pensacola high waves caused beach erosion and closed nearby roadways there were five tornadoes in the northwestern portion of the state though none of them caused significant damage throughout the florida panhandle the storm resulted in an estimated 100 million in damage there were two indirect fatalities from katrina in walton county as a result of a traffic accident 1 in the florida panhandle 77,000 customers lost power 53 overall the hurricane killed 14 people and caused at least 623 million in damage before striking south florida katrina traversed the bahamas as a tropical storm however minimal impact was reported with only fresh breezes on various islands 54 although hurricane katrina stayed well to the north of cuba on august 29 it brought tropical-storm force winds and rainfall of over 8 in 200 mm to western regions of the island telephone and power lines were damaged and around 8,000 people were evacuated in the pinar del río province according to cuban television reports the coastal town of surgidero de batabanó was 90 underwater 55 louisiana flooding in venice louisiana on august 29, hurricane katrina made landfall near buras-triumph louisiana with 125 mph 200 km h winds a strong category 3 storm however as it had only just weakened from category 4 strength and the radius of maximum winds was large it is possible that sustained winds of category 4 strength briefly impacted extreme southeastern louisiana although the storm surge to the east of the path of the eye in mississippi was higher a very significant surge affected the louisiana coast the height of the surge is uncertain because of a lack of data although a tide gauge in plaquemines parish indicated a storm tide in excess of 14 feet 4.3 m and a 12-foot 3.7 m storm surge was recorded in grand isle hurricane katrina made final landfall near the mouth of the pearl river with the eye straddling st tammany parish louisiana and hancock county mississippi on the morning of august 29 at about 9 45m cst 1 hurricane katrina also brought heavy rain to louisiana with 8–10 inches 200–250 mm falling on a wide swath of the eastern part of the state in the area around slidell the rainfall was even higher and the highest rainfall recorded in the state was approximately 15 inches 380 mm  as a result of the rainfall and storm surge the level of lake pontchartrain rose and caused significant flooding along its northeastern shore affecting communities from slidell to mandeville several bridges were destroyed including the i-10 twin span bridge connecting slidell to new orleans 1 almost 900,000 people in louisiana lost power as a result of hurricane katrina 56 katrina s storm surge inundated all parishes surrounding lake pontchartrain including st tammany tangipahoa st john the baptist and st charles parishes st tammany parish received a two-part storm surge the first surge came as lake pontchartrain rose and the storm blew water from the gulf of mexico into the lake the second came as the eye of katrina passed westerly winds pushed water into a bottleneck at the rigolets pass forcing it farther inland the range of surge levels in eastern st tammany parish is estimated at 13–16 feet 4.0–4.9 m  not including wave action 57 hard-hit st bernard parish was flooded because of breaching of the levees that contained a navigation channel called the mississippi river gulf outlet mr-go and the breach of the 40 arpent canal levee that was designed and built by the orleans levee board the search for the missing was undertaken by the st bernard fire department because of the assets of the united states coast guard being diverted to new orleans in the months after the storm many of the missing were tracked down by searching flooded homes tracking credit card records and visiting homes of family and relatives 58

although power failures prevented accurate measurement of wind speeds in new orleans there were a few measurements of hurricane-force winds from this the nhc concluded that it is likely that much of the city experienced sustained winds of category 1 or category 2 strength katrina s storm surge led to 53 levee breaches in the federally built levee system protecting metro new orleans and the failure of the 40 arpent canal levee nearly every levee in metro new orleans was breached as hurricane katrina passed just east of the city limits failures occurred in new orleans and surrounding communities especially st bernard parish the mississippi river gulf outlet mr-go breached its levees in approximately 20 places flooding much of east new orleans most of st bernard parish and the east bank of plaquemines parish the major levee breaches in the city included breaches at the 17th street canal levee the london avenue canal and the wide navigable industrial canal which left approximately 80 of the city flooded 61 most of the major roads traveling into and out of the city were damaged the only routes out of the city were the westbound crescent city connection and the huey

humanitarian and rescue operations limited commercial passenger service resumed at the airport on september 13 and regular carrier operations resumed in early october 66 levee breaches in new orleans also caused a significant number of deaths with over 700 bodies recovered in new orleans by october 23, 2005. 67 some survivors and evacuees reported seeing dead bodies lying in city streets and floating in still-flooded sections especially in the east of the city the advanced state of decomposition of many corpses some of which were left in the water or sun for days before being collected hindered efforts by coroners to identify many of the dead 68 a u.s coast guardsman searches for survivors in new orleans in the katrina aftermath the first deaths reported from the city were reported shortly before midnight on august 28, as three nursing home patients died during an evacuation to baton rouge most likely from dehydration an estimated 215 bodies were found in nursing homes and hospitals in new orleans 69 the largest number being at the memorial medical center where 45 corpses were recovered 70 some 200 patients at the charity hospital weren t evacuated until friday september 2, having been without power or fresh water for five days 71 while there were also early reports of fatalities amid mayhem at the superdome only six deaths were confirmed there with four of these originating from natural causes one from a drug overdose and one a suicide at the convention center four bodies were recovered one of the four is believed to be the result of a homicide 72 there

economic effects of hurricane katrina the economic effects of the storm reached high levels the bush administration sought 105 billion for repairs and reconstruction in the region 90 which did not account for damage to the economy caused by potential interruption of the oil supply destruction of the gulf coast s highway infrastructure and exports of commodities such as grain katrina damaged or destroyed 30 oil platforms and caused the closure of nine refineries 48 the total shut-in oil production from the gulf of mexico in the six-month period following katrina was approximately 24 of the annual production and the shut-in gas production for the same period was about 18  91 the forestry industry in mississippi was also affected as 1.3 million acres 5,300 km2 of forest lands were destroyed 92 the total loss to the forestry industry from katrina is calculated to rise to about 5 billion 92 furthermore hundreds of thousands of local residents were left unemployed before the hurricane the region supported approximately one million non-farm jobs with 600,000 of them in new orleans it is estimated that the total economic impact in louisiana and mississippi may eventually exceed 150 billion 93 forensic accountants were involved in the assessment of economic damages resulting from this catastrophe 94 katrina displaced over one million people from the central gulf coast to elsewhere across the united states becoming the largest diaspora in the history of the united states 95 houston texas had an increase of 35,000 people mobile alabama gained over 24,000 baton rouge louisiana over 15,000 and hammond louisiana received over 10,000, nearly doubling its size chicago illinois received over 6,000 people the most of any non-southern city 96 by late january 2006, about 200,000 people were once again living in new orleans less than half of the pre-storm population 97 by july 1, 2006, when new population estimates were calculated by the u.s census bureau the state of louisiana showed a population decline of 219,563, or 4.87  98 additionally some insurance companies have stopped insuring homeowners in the area because of the high costs from hurricanes katrina and

areas in dauphin island a barrier island  approximately 90 mi 140 km to the east of the point where the hurricane made landfall the sand that comprised the island was transported across the island into the mississippi sound pushing the island towards land 101 the storm surge and waves from katrina also severely damaged the chandeleur islands which had been affected by hurricane ivan the previous year 102 the us geological survey has estimated 217 sq mi 560 km2 of land was transformed to water by the hurricanes katrina and rita 103 before the storm subsidence and erosion caused loss of land in the louisiana wetlands and bayous this along with the canals built in the area let katrina keep more of its intensity when it struck 104 the lands that were lost were breeding grounds for marine mammals brown pelicans turtles and fish and migratory species such as redhead ducks 92 overall about 20 of the local marshes were permanently overrun by water as a result of the storm 92 the damage from katrina forced the closure of 16 national wildlife refuges breton national wildlife refuge lost half its area in the storm 105 as a result the hurricane affected the habitats of sea turtles mississippi sandhill cranes red-cockaded woodpeckers and alabama beach mice 105 katrina also produced massive tree loss along the gulf coast particularly in louisiana a pearl river basin and among bottomland hardwood forests before the storm the standard mortality rate for the area s trees was 1.9  but this interval increased to 20.5 by the end of 2006. 106 delayed mortality as an effect of the storm continued with rates up to 5 until 2011. 107 this significant loss in biomass caused greater decay and an increase in carbon emissions for example by 2006 the decreased biomass in bottomland hardwood forests contributed an amount of carbon which equated to roughly 140 of the net annual u.s carbon sink in forest trees 108 the chandeleur islands before katrina left and after right  showing the impact of the storm along coastal areas the storm caused oil spills from 44 facilities throughout southeastern louisiana which resulted in over 7 million us gallons 26,000 m3 of oil being leaked some spills were only a few hundred gallons and most were contained on-site though some oil entered the ecosystem and residential areas after a spill at the murphy oil refinery for example 1,800 homes were oiled in the towns of chalmette and meraux 100 unlike hurricane ivan no offshore oil spills were officially reported after hurricane katrina however skytruth reported some signs of surface oil in the gulf of mexico 100 finally as part of the cleanup effort the flood waters that covered new orleans were pumped into lake pontchartrain a process that took 43 days to

residents of new orleans who remained in the city began looting stores many were in search of food and water that were not available to them through any other means as well as non-essential items 109 additionally there were reports of carjacking murders thefts and rapes in new orleans some sources later determined that many of the reports were inaccurate greatly exaggerated or completely false leading news agencies to print retractions 110 thousands of national guard and federal troops were mobilized and sent to louisiana with 7,841 in the area on august 29, to a maximum of 46,838 on

civilians and seriously injured other others at danziger bridge 113 five former police officers pleaded guilty to charges connected to the danziger bridge shootings in the aftermath of the hurricane six other former or current officers appeared in court in june 2011. 114 overall a number of arrests were made throughout the affected area including some near the new orleans convention center a temporary jail was constructed of chain link cages in the new orleans union passenger terminal the city s main train station 115 in west virginia where roughly 350 refugees were located local officials took fingerprints to run criminal background checks on the refugees the background checks found that 45 of the refugees had a criminal record of some nature and that 22 had a violent criminal record 116 media speculation fueled a popular perception that the displaced new orleans residents brought a wave of crime into the communities where they relocated however detailed studies of crime statistics in these communities did not reveal a significant increase in violent crime 117 118 119 government response chart showing some common uses of the fema marking system in new orleans after hurricane katrina president bush stands with secretary of defense donald rumsfeld secretary of labor elaine chao and secretary of health and human services mike leavitt during a press conference from the rose garden regarding the devastation along the gulf coast caused by katrina within the united states and as delineated in the national response plan disaster response and planning is first and foremost a local government responsibility when local government exhausts its resources it then requests specific additional resources from the county level the request process proceeds similarly from the county to the state to the federal government as additional resource needs are identified many of the problems that arose developed from inadequate planning and back-up communication systems at various levels 120 some disaster recovery response to katrina began before the storm with federal emergency management agency fema preparations that ranged from logistical supply deployments to a mortuary team with refrigerated trucks a network of volunteers began rendering assistance to local residents and residents emerging from new orleans and surrounding parishes as soon as the storm made landfall even though many were directed to not enter the area  and continued for more than six months after the storm 120 of the 60,000 people stranded in new orleans the coast guard rescued more than 33,500. 121 congress recognized the coast guard s response with an official entry in the congressional record 122 and the armed service was awarded the presidential unit citation 123 the united states northern command established joint task force jtf katrina based out of camp shelby mississippi to act as the military s on-scene response on sunday august 28, with us army lieutenant general russel l honoré as commander 124 approximately 58,000 national guard personnel were activated to deal with the storm s aftermath with troops coming from all 50 states 125 the department of defense also activated volunteer members of the civil air patrol michael chertoff secretary of the department of homeland security decided to take over the federal state and local operations officially on august 30, 2005, citing the national response plan 126 this was refused by governor blanco who indicated that her national guard could manage early in september congress authorized a total of 62.3 billion in aid for victims 127 additionally president bush enlisted the help of former presidents bill clinton and george h w bush to raise additional voluntary contributions much as they did after the 2004 indian ocean earthquake and tsunami 128 american flags were also ordered to be half-staff from september 2, 2005, to september 20, 2005, in honor of the victims 129 fema provided housing assistance rental assistance trailers etc to more than 700,000 applicants—families and individuals however only one-fifth of the trailers requested in orleans parish were supplied resulting in an enormous housing shortage in the city of new orleans 130 many local areas voted to not allow the trailers and many areas had no utilities a requirement prior to placing the trailers to provide for additional housing fema has also paid for the hotel costs of 12,000 individuals and families displaced by katrina through february 7, 2006, when a final deadline was set for the end of hotel cost coverage after this deadline evacuees were still eligible to receive federal assistance which could be used towards either apartment rent additional hotel stays or fixing their ruined homes although fema no longer paid for hotels directly 131 as of march 30, 2010, there were still 260 families living in fema-provided trailers in louisiana and mississippi 132 law enforcement and public safety agencies from across the united states provided a mutual aid response to louisiana and new orleans in the weeks following the disaster many agencies responded with manpower and equipment from as far away as california michigan nevada new york and texas this response was welcomed by local louisiana authorities as their staff were either becoming fatigued stretched too thin or even quitting from the job 133 two weeks after the storm more than half of the states were involved in providing shelter for evacuees by four weeks after the storm evacuees had been registered in all 50 states and in 18,700 zip codes—half of the nation s residential postal zones most evacuees had stayed within 250 miles 400 km  but 240,000 households went to houston and other cities over 250 miles 400 km away and another 60,000 households went over 750 miles 1,200 km away 134 criticism of government response main article criticism of government response to hurricane katrina usns comfort takes on supplies at mayport florida en route to the gulf coast the criticisms of the government s response to hurricane katrina primarily consisted of criticism of mismanagement and lack of leadership in the relief efforts in response to the storm and its aftermath more specifically the criticism focused on the delayed response to the flooding of new orleans and the subsequent state of chaos in the city 72 the neologism katrinagate was coined to refer to this controversy and was a runner-up for 2005 word of the year 135 within days of katrina s august 29 landfall public debate arose about the local state and federal governments role in the preparations for and response to the hurricane criticism was initially prompted by televised images of visibly shaken and frustrated political leaders and of residents who remained stranded by flood waters without water food or shelter deaths from thirst exhaustion and violence days after the storm had passed fueled the criticism as did the dilemma of the evacuees at facilities such as the louisiana superdome and the new orleans civic center some alleged that race class and other factors could have contributed to delays in government response for example during a concert for hurricane relief a benefit concert for victims of the hurricane rapper kanye west veered off script and harshly criticized the government s response to the crisis stating that george bush doesn t care about black people 136 in accordance with federal law president george w bush directed the secretary of the department of homeland security michael chertoff to coordinate the federal response chertoff designated michael d brown head of the federal emergency management agency as the principal federal official to lead the deployment and coordination of all federal response resources and forces in the gulf coast region however the president and secretary chertoff initially came under harsh criticism for what some perceived as a lack of planning and coordination brown claimed that governor blanco resisted their efforts and was unhelpful governor blanco and her staff disputed this 137 eight days later brown was recalled to washington and coast guard vice admiral thad w allen replaced him as chief of hurricane relief operations 138 three days after the recall michael d brown resigned as director of fema in spite of having received recent praise from president bush 139 politicians activists pundits and journalists also directed criticism at the local and state governments headed by mayor nagin of new orleans and louisiana governor blanco nagin and blanco were criticized for failing to implement new orleans evacuation plan and for ordering residents to a shelter of last resort without any provisions for food water security or sanitary conditions perhaps the most important criticism of nagin was that he delayed his emergency evacuation order until 19 hours before landfall which led to hundreds of deaths of people who could not find any way out of the city 11 the destruction wrought by hurricane katrina raised other more general public policy issues about emergency management environmental policy poverty and unemployment the discussion of both the immediate response and of the broader public policy issues may have affected elections and legislation enacted at various levels of government the storm s devastation also prompted a congressional investigation which found that fema and the red cross did not have a logistics capacity sophisticated enough to fully support the massive number of gulf coast victims additionally it placed responsibility for the disaster on all three levels of government 11 an abc news poll conducted on september 2, 2005, showed more blame was being directed at state and local governments 75 than at the federal government 67  with 44 blaming bush s leadership directly 140 a later cnn usatoday gallup poll showed that respondents disagreed widely on who was to blame for the problems in the city following the hurricane — 13 said bush 18 said federal agencies 25 blamed state or local officials and 38 said no one was to blame 141 a 2013 pool of louisiana republicans found more 29 blamed barack obama for the poor federal response to the hurricane than george w bush 28  despite the fact that bush was actually president during the storm and obama merely a junior senator 142 143 international

organizations raised us 4.25 billion in donations by the public with the red cross receiving over half of the donations 160 some smaller organizations and individuals ignored the access restrictions and provided early relief for example two privately chartered planes from fastercures evacuated 200 patents from charity hospital in new orleans 161 volunteers from amateur radio s emergency service wing the amateur radio emergency service provided communications in areas where the communications infrastructure had been damaged or totally destroyed relaying everything from 911 traffic to messages home 162 in hancock county mississippi ham radio operators provided the only communications into or out of the area and even served as 911 dispatchers 163 many corporations also contributed to relief efforts on september 13, 2005, it was reported that corporate donations to the relief effort were 409 million and were expected to exceed 1 billion 164 during and after the hurricanes katrina wilma and rita the american red cross had opened 1,470 shelters and registered 3.8 million overnight stays none were allowed in new orleans however a total of 244,000 red cross workers 95 of which were non-paid volunteers were utilized throughout these three hurricanes in addition 346,980 comfort kits such as toothpaste soap washcloths and toys for children and 205,360 cleanup kits containing brooms mops and bleach were distributed for mass care the organization served 68 million snacks and meals to victims of the disasters and to rescue workers the red cross also had its disaster health services meet 596,810 contacts and disaster mental health services met 826,590 contacts red cross emergency financial assistance was provided to 1.4 million families hurricane katrina was the first natural disaster in the united states in which the american red cross utilized its safe and well family location website 165 166 in the year following katrina s strike on the gulf coast the salvation army allocated donations of more than 365 million to serve more than 1.7 million people in nearly every state the organization s immediate response to hurricane katrina included more than 5.7 million hot meals and about 8.3 million sandwiches snacks and drinks served in and around new orleans its satern network of amateur radio operators picked up where modern communications left off to help locate more than 25,000 survivors salvation army pastoral care counselors were on hand to comfort the emotional and spiritual needs of 277,000 individuals as part of the overall effort salvation army officers employees and volunteers contributed more than 900,000 hours of service 167 analysis of new orleans levee failures main article 2005 levee failures in greater new orleans view of the eyewall of hurricane katrina taken on august 28, 2005, as seen from a noaa wp-3d hurricane hunter aircraft before the storm made landfall on the united states gulf coast on april 5, 2006, months after independent investigators had demonstrated that levee failures were not caused by natural forces beyond intended design strength lieutenant general carl strock chief of engineers and commander of the corps of engineers testified before the united states senate subcommittee on energy and water that we have now concluded we had problems with the design of the structure 168 a june 2007 report released by the american society of civil engineers determined that the failures of the levees and floodwalls in new orleans were found to be primarily the result of system design and construction flaws 47 the us army corps of engineers is federally mandated in the flood control act of 1965 with responsibility for the conception design and construction of the region s flood-control system according to report published in august 2015 in the official journal of the world water council the corps misinterpreted the results of a 1985 study and wrongly concluded that sheet piles in the flood walls needed to be driven to depths of only 17 feet 5 m instead of between 31 and 46 feet 9 and 14 m  that decision saved approximately us 100 million but significantly reduced overall engineering reliability 169 other factors may have contributed to the flooding according to the authors of catastrophe in the making island press 2009  the straight design and lack of outward flow into the gulf allowed the mississippi river-gulf outlet canal to become the perfect shortcut for salt-water intrusion which damaged buffering cypress forests and wetlands which historically had protected new orleans from storm surge 170 the army corps of engineers built and maintained the canal furthermore according to storm surge researcher hassan mashriqui storm surge pushing across shallow lake borgne from the east is constrained by these mrgo levees to the south and to the north by the long-standing levees of the intracoastal waterway giww  initially ten or more miles apart these two channels meet and when they do the water building between their levees is squeezed into a single channel – the funnel – only 260 yards wide constrained by levees 14 feet to 16 feet high….in concert with the denuded marshes it could increase the local storm surge hitting the intracoastal waterway by 20 percent to 40 percent – a critical and fundamental flaw 171 the corps of engineers disputes these causalities 172 nonetheless in june 2008, the army corps of engineers new orleans district submitted a deep-draft de-authorization study of the mrgo which stated that an economic evaluation of channel navigation use does not demonstrate a federal interest in continued operation and maintenance of the channel congress ordered the mrgo closed as a direct result many of the levees have been reconstructed since the time of katrina in reconstructing them precautions were taken to bring the levees up to modern building code standards and to ensure their safety for example in every situation possible the corps of engineers replaced i-walls with t-walls t-walls have a horizontal concrete base that protects against soil erosion underneath the floodwalls 173 however there are funding battles over the remaining levee improvements in february 2008, the bush administration requested that the state of louisiana pay about 1.5 billion of an estimated 7.2 billion for corps of engineers levee work in accordance with the principles of local cost sharing required by congress as early as the flood control act of 1928  a proposal which angered many louisiana leaders 174 on may 2, 2008, louisiana gov bobby jindal used a speech to the national press club to request that president bush free up money to complete work on louisiana s levees bush promised to include the levee funding in his 2009 budget but rejected the idea of including the funding in a war bill which would pass sooner 175 media involvement main article media coverage of hurricane katrina many representatives of the news media reporting on the aftermath of hurricane katrina became directly involved in the unfolding events instead of simply reporting because of the loss of most means of communication such as land-based and cellular telephone systems field reporters in many cases became conduits for information between victims and authorities the authorities who monitored local and network news broadcasts as well as internet sites would then attempt to coordinate rescue efforts based on the reports one illustration was when geraldo rivera of fox news tearfully pleaded for authorities to either send help or evacuate the thousands of evacuees stranded at the ernest n morial convention center 176 the role of am radio was also of importance to the hundreds of thousands of persons with no other ties to news providing emergency
