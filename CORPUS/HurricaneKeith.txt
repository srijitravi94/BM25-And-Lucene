peninsula mexico belize part of the 2000 atlantic hurricane season hurricane keith was an atlantic hurricane in october 2000 that caused extensive damage in central america especially in mexico and belize it was the fifteenth tropical cyclone eleventh named storm and seventh hurricane of the that year s atlantic hurricane season keith developed as a tropical depression from a tropical wave in the western caribbean sea on september 28. the depression gradually strengthened and became tropical storm keith on the following day as the storm tracked westward it continued to intensify and was upgraded to a hurricane on september 30. shortly thereafter keith began to rapidly deepen and peaked as a category 4 hurricane less than 24 hours later keith then began to meander erratically offshore of belize which significantly weakened the storm due to land interaction by late on october 2, keith made landfall in ambergris caye belize as a minimal hurricane it quickly weakened to a tropical storm before another landfall occurred near belize city early on the following day while moving inland over the yucatán peninsula keith weakened further and was downgraded to a tropical depression before emerging into the gulf of mexico on october 4. once in the gulf of mexico keith began to re-strengthen and was upgraded to a tropical storm later that day and a hurricane on the following day by late on october 5, keith made its third and final landfall near tampico tamaulipas mexico as a moderately strong category 1 hurricane the storm quickly weakened inland and dissipated as a tropical cyclone by 24 hours after landfall keith brought heavy rainfall to several countries in central america which resulted in extensive flooding especially in belize and mexico in guatemala the storm flooded 10 towns and caused one fatality similarly one fatality also occurred in el salvador and at least 300 people were affected by flooding in that country thirteen communities in nicaragua were completely isolated after keith made roads impassable twelve deaths were reported in nicaragua all of which were flood-related five people were presumed dead in honduras after an aircraft disappeared near roatán one other fatality occurred due to flooding the storm brought torrential rainfall to belize with many areas reporting at least 10 inches 250 mm of rain while highest reported amount of precipitation was greater than 30 inches 760 mm  in belize a village reported that only 12 houses remained while elsewhere in the country at least 60 homes were destroyed or damaged several houses in

overall keith was responsible for 68 deaths and 319 million 2000 usd in damage 1 meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale on september 16, 2000 a tropical wave – an elongated area of low air pressure moving from east to west – exited the west coast of africa it moved westward across the atlantic ocean without development due to the presence of upper-level wind shear after moving across the caribbean sea a disturbance along the wave started to become better organized on september 27. 2 the next day a hurricane hunters flight indicated a closed circulation and winds of 37 mph 60 km h upon receiving the data the national hurricane center nhc initiated advisories on tropical depression fifteen at 2100 utc 3 the nhc later estimated the depression had formed three hours earlier about 70 mi 110 km north-northeast of cabo gracias a dios 2 upon forming the depression had good outflow although the convection was not as organized 3 with an anticyclone over the system the depression was expected to gradually intensify while moving slowly to the west-northwest a motion caused by weak steering winds 4 late on september 28, the nhc upgraded the depression to tropical storm status and named it keith 2 after another hurricane hunters mission reported flight-level winds of 61 mph 98 km h  5 hurricane keith near landfall in belize on october 1 by the time keith became a tropical storm it was beginning to undergo rapid deepening 2 fueled by warm waters low wind shear and an organizing cloud pattern 5 there initially was uncertainty in the storm s future movement due to a ridge in the gulf of mexico tropical cyclone prediction models differed on their assessments three models anticipated a turn to the northeast toward florida due to a trough while others predicted a continued slow motion to the west-northwest eventually reaching the bay of campeche 6 after continued strengthening keith became a hurricane on september 30, just 18 hours after becoming a tropical storm 2 and making it the seventh such storm of that intensity of the season 7 that day an eye began developing as the structure became much better organized 8 in a 13‑hour period beginning at 1808 utc on september 30, keith underwent explosive deepening as its barometric pressure dropped at a rate of nearly 3 mbar 0.089 inhg per hour 2 the nhc noted that keith experienced conditions ideal for strengthening  with the exception of the approaching land interaction with the yucatán peninsula 9 the hurricane slowed until stalling offshore eastern belize caused by the ridge to the north and the precursor to tropical storm leslie forming over cuba 2 by early on october 1, keith had developed a well-defined eye about 20 mi 32 km in diameter with what the nhc described as a spectacular appearance 10 later that day hurricane hunters estimated a minimum pressure of 939 mbar 27.7 inhg and deployed a dropsonde that observed peak winds of 176 mph 283 km h  based on the data the nhc estimated that keith attained peak winds of 140 mph 220 km h at 0700 utc on october 1, while just offshore eastern belize this made it a category 4 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale 2 shortly after keith reached peak intensity the eye had moved over portions of belize causing it to lose definition outflow became restricted and the developing disturbance to the northeast increased wind shear as a result keith began to weaken steadily on october 1. 11 while remaining nearly stationary keith made a landfall on ambergris cay late on october 2 as a minimal hurricane shortly thereafter keith weakened into a tropical storm 2 and its convection became limited to the southeastern quadrant 12 at 0300 utc the storm made its second landfall about 29 mi 47 km north of belize city and within nine hours weakened into a tropical depression 2 the building ridge to the north caused the system to accelerate more to the west-northwest across the yucatán peninsula 13 early on october 4, keith emerged into the bay of campeche 2 where favorable conditions allowed convection to quickly redevelop 14 later that day it re-intensified into a tropical storm 2 with improved outflow and convective organization 15 on october 5, the hurricane hunters reported a circular eye had reformed along with winds supporting an upgrade to hurricane status 16 keith intensified further that day until it made its final landfall 23 mi 37 km north of tampico with winds of 90 mph 150 km h  2 it rapidly weakened over the high terrain of northeastern mexico 17 dissipating late on october 6. 2 preparations edit on september 29, shortly after keith formed a hurricane watch was issued for the yucatán peninsula from chetumal to cabo catoche in quintana roo the next day as keith was nearing hurricane intensity the watch was upgraded to a warning and a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for the belize coastline from belize city to the mexican border at that time the trajectory was expected to go more to the northwest and when the storm turned to a slow westward drift hurricane warnings were issued for the belize coast with only about 24 hours of lead time for the offshore islands the warnings for the yucatán peninsula were dropped as keith weakened 2 on october 2, the government of belize declared a state of emergency and activated the entire belize defence force due to the storm s threat 18 the airport in belize city was closed during keith s passage limiting transportation from the
