saffir–simpson scale a tropical wave moved off the west coast of africa on september 16. a low level center of circulation developed from a tropical disturbance spawned by this tropical wave midway between the african coast and the caribbean on september 20. the next day the system gained sufficient organization to become a tropical depression 1 5 the depression moved westward in excess of 20 mph 32 km h  and reached tropical storm strength-becoming tropical storm lili as it passed through the windward islands 6 the cyclone continued to intensify as it moved west through the caribbean sea reaching a peak strength of 70 mph 110 km h on the morning of september 24. 7 this was immediately followed by an abrupt weakening and the storm s maximum sustained winds dropped to 40 mph 64 km h later that day 8 the sudden weakening was attributed to strong southerly vertical shear 9 the system degenerated into an open tropical wave the next morning and remained in that state for nearly two

on october 2 while 365 miles 587 km south-southeast of new orleans 13 this intensification continued aided by warm sea surface temperatures in the gulf of mexico and good outflow 14 the system reached its peak strength of category 4 intensity with winds of 145 mph 233 km h  during that afternoon 15 this strength was not maintained for long the storm began to quickly weaken in the early morning hours of october 3, 16 and this rapid weakening continued until the hurricane s final landfall near intracoastal city louisiana due to a combination of vertical wind shear cool waters just offshore louisiana 17 and slowly encroaching dry air within its southwest quadrant 18 by the time of landfall maximum sustained winds had dropped to 90 mph 145 km h  19 the weakening was accompanied by a collapse of the inner eyewall before landfall 1 the system continued inland curving to the north-northeast and dissipated when absorbed by an extratropical low near the arkansas tennessee border on
