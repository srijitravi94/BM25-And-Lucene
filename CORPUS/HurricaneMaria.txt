rico dominican republic haiti turks and caicos islands the bahamas southeastern united states mid-atlantic states ireland united kingdom france spain part of the 2017 atlantic hurricane season hurricane maria is regarded as the worst natural disaster on record in dominica and caused catastrophic damage and a major humanitarian crisis in puerto rico the tenth-most intense atlantic hurricane on record maria was the thirteenth named storm seventh consecutive hurricane fourth major hurricane and the second category 5 hurricane of the hyperactive 2017 atlantic hurricane season at its peak the hurricane caused catastrophic damage and numerous fatalities across the northeastern caribbean compounding recovery efforts in the areas of the leeward islands already struck by hurricane irma just two weeks prior maria was the third consecutive major hurricane to threaten the leeward islands in two weeks after irma made landfall in several of the islands two weeks prior and hurricane jose passed dangerously close bringing tropical storm force winds to barbuda originating from a tropical wave maria became a tropical storm on september 16, east of the lesser antilles highly favorable environmental conditions allowed the storm to undergo explosive intensification as it approached the island arc the hurricane reached category 5 strength on september 18 upon making landfall on dominica producing extreme winds across the entire island afterwards maria achieved its peak intensity over the eastern caribbean with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph 280 km h and a pressure of 908 mbar hpa 26.81 inhg  making it the tenth-most intense atlantic hurricane on record weakening slightly but retaining its ferocious winds maria struck puerto rico as a high-end category 4 hurricane on september 20. interaction with land weakened the hurricane though it regained some strength as it moved northeast of the bahamas moving slowly to the north maria gradually degraded and weakened to a tropical storm on september 28. embedded in the westerlies maria accelerated toward the east and later east-northeast over the open atlantic becoming extratropical on september 30 and dissipating by october 3. as of november 3, at least 98 people are confirmed to have been killed by the hurricane 54 in puerto rico 28 in dominica 5 in the dominican republic 4 in the contiguous united states 3 in haiti 2 in guadeloupe and 1 in the united states virgin islands hundreds of others mostly in dominica and puerto rico are still missing san juan mayor yulín cruz claimed that the actual death toll in puerto rico may actually be as high as 500. 1 maria wrought catastrophic damage to the entirety of dominica which suffered an island-wide communication blackout much of the housing stock and infrastructure were left beyond repair while the island s lush vegetation had been practically eradicated the islands of guadeloupe and martinique endured widespread flooding damaged roofs and uprooted trees puerto rico suffered catastrophic damage including destruction of its previously damaged electrical grid for weeks in maria s wake most of the island s population suffered from flooding and lack of resources compounded by the slow relief process total losses from the hurricane are estimated at between 15.9 and 95 billion 2017 usd  mostly in puerto rico making maria s cost comparable to that of previous hurricanes irma and harvey 2 3 4 5 meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale the national hurricane center nhc began monitoring two tropical waves on september 13. 6 the easternmost wave quickly spun up into what would become hurricane lee while the western one continued moving generally westward with generally favorable conditions in the disturbance s path development into a tropical cyclone seemed likely 7 during those two days the disturbance became better organized 8 and by september 16, convective banding became established around a poorly organized circulation as the system was an imminent threat to land despite the center not being well-defined the nhc initiated advisories on it as potential tropical cyclone fifteen at 15 00 utc in accordance with a policy change enacted at the start of the season 9 10 a mid-level ridge anchored north of the disturbance steered it generally west-northwest into a region highly favorable for further development sea surface temperatures of 84 °f 29 °c  low wind shear and ample moisture were anticipated to foster strengthening to hurricane-status before the system reached the lesser antilles 9 11 as the disturbance continued to grow increasingly well-defined throughout the day it was later upgraded to a moderate-range tropical storm – based on satellite estimates – at 21 00 utc that day receiving the name maria 12 at that time maria was situated 620 mi 1,000 km east-southeast of the lesser antilles 13 most intense atlantic

maria to become further organized throughout the early morning hours of september 17. 11 after a brief intrusion of dry air exposed the circulation 15 a convective burst occurred over the center and intensification resumed hurricane hunters investigating the system observed surface winds of 74 mph 119 km h and a formative eye feature accordingly the nhc upgraded maria to hurricane status at 21 00 utc 16 expansion of the central dense overcast and an increasingly complete eyewall signaled steady intensification throughout the overnight of september 17–18 17 considerable lightning activity was identified within the hurricane s core early on september 18 and statistical models indicated a high probability of rapid intensification 18 explosive strengthening took place shortly thereafter with aircraft reconnaissance finding surface winds of 120 mph 195 km h and a central pressure of 959 mbar hpa 28.32 inhg  making maria a category 3 hurricane on the saffir–simpson scale and hence a major hurricane additionally radar data revealed a well-defined 12 mi 19 km wide eye 19 the eye contracted slightly to 9 mi 14 km as intensification continued and the system reached category 4 strength by 21 00 utc 20 radar imagery of hurricane maria from puerto rico at 09 36 utc 5 36 a.m local time  shortly before it stopped transmitting data rapid intensification culminated late on september 18, with maria achieving category 5 status just 15 mi 25 km east-southeast of dominica 21 hurricane hunters observed surface winds of 160 mph 260 km h and a pressure of 925 mbar hpa 27.32 inhg at this time 22 maria made landfall in dominica at 01 15 utc on september 19, 23 becoming the first category 5 hurricane on record to strike the island nation 24 interaction with the mountains of dominica imparted slight weakening of the hurricane to category 4 however once over the caribbean sea maria regained category 5 intensity 25 26 additional strengthening took place as the storm tracked northwest toward puerto rico despite the formation of concentric eyewalls—the larger one spanning 25 to 35 mi 40 to 56 km and the smaller only 5 mi 8.0 km  signalling the start of an eyewall replacement cycle—the inner violent core remained undisrupted through the afternoon 27 maria attained its peak intensity around 04 00 utc on september 20, roughly 30 mi 45 km south of st croix sustained winds reached 175 mph 280 km h and its central pressure bottomed out at 908 mbar hpa 26.85 inhg this ranks it as the tenth-most intense atlantic hurricane since reliable records began 28 29 30 infrared loop of hurricane maria passing st croix vieques and landfalling on puerto rico on the morning of september 20 the hurricane made its closest approach to st croix around 05 00 utc on september 20, passing within 20 mi 30 km of the island the storm s outer eyewall lashed the island while the more violent inner eye remained offshore 31 hours later around 08 00 utc the outer eyewall struck vieques an island off the eastern coast of puerto rico 32 by this time the outer eye became dominant as the inner one decayed and the eyewall replacement cycle caused maria to weaken to category 4 strength 33 maria made landfall just south of yabucoa puerto rico around 10 15 utc with sustained winds of 155 mph 250 km h  34 making it the strongest to hit the island since the 1928 san felipe segundo hurricane 35 maria maintained a general west-northwest course across puerto rico emerging over the atlantic ocean shortly before 18 00 utc interaction with the mountainous terrain resulted in substantial weakening sustained winds fell to 110 mph 175 km h and the central pressure rose to 957 mbars hpa 28.26 inhg  36 with favorable environmental conditions maria steadily reorganized as it moved away from puerto rico a large eye 45 mi 75 km wide developed with deep convection blossoming around it early on september 21, the system regained category 3 intensity 37 initially cooler waters stirred up by hurricane irma two weeks prior limited maria s reorganization 38 during the afternoon of september 21, the system traversed the navidad and silver banks north of the dominican republic shoaling from the region s shallow waters temporarily interfered with measurements of surface winds 39 convection around the storm s eye deepened and its eye became better defined that night and the hurricane reached a tertiary peak with sustained winds of 125 mph 205 km h  40 an increase in southwesterly wind shear prompted gradual weakening of the hurricane starting with restriction of banding features and later degradation of the eyewall 41 42 late on september 22, the hurricane turned north-northwest as it reached the western periphery of the ridge previously steering it northwest 43 maria fluctuated in organization throughout september 23, with its eye periodically clearing and becoming cloud-filled it maintained category 3 hurricane strength during this phase 44 45 despite a decreasing central pressure the storm finally weakened to category 2 strength early on september 24. hurricane hunters observed flight-level winds of 116 to 135 mph 187 to 217 km h however surface wind returns by the noaa s stepped-frequency microwave radiometer were only 90 mph 150 km h  this indicated below-average mixing down of winds aloft 46 47 by this time maria s trajectory shifted almost due north between the aforementioned ridge and a cut-off low over the eastern gulf of mexico 47 weakening accelerated later on september 24 into september 25, as the hurricane traversed a cold wake—with sea surface temperatures of 75–77 °f 24–25 °c —created by hurricane jose a week prior maria degraded to category 1 strength during this time 48 early on september 25, maria s structure changed dramatically as its inner-core collapsed the low-level circulation became exposed to the northwest and most of the deep convection shifted to the eastern half of the storm 49 maria further weakened into a tropical storm during the late afternoon of september 26. 50 however a sustained convective burst resulted in maria s winds increasing to hurricane-force once again on september 27, 51 with banding features evident on the eastern part of the circulation 52 despite this northwesterly wind shear continued to impinge on the storm and maria once again weakened to a tropical storm early on september 28. simultaneously maria began to accelerate to the east-northeast as it became embedded into the mid-latitude westerlies 53 gradually weakening maria soon began to move over sea surface temperatures of 73 °f 23 °c and below causing most of its convection to dissipate late on september 30, maria transitioned into an extratropical cyclone 54 during the next couple of days maria s remnant accelerated towards the united kingdom while rapidly weakening 55 56 maria s remnants later crossed the iberian peninsula into the western mediterranean sea on october 3, before being absorbed by another frontal system later on the same day 57 preparations edit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it september 2017 play media the u.s navy helps evacuate military personnel

a category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph 260 km h  23 these winds the most extreme to ever impact the island 104 battered the roof of practically every home—including the official residence of prime minister roosevelt skerrit who required rescue when his home began to flood 105 downing all cellular radio and internet services maria effectively cut dominica off from the outside world the situation there remained unclear for a couple of days after the hurricane s passage 106 107 skerrit called the devastation mind boggling before going offline and indicated immediate priority was to rescue survivors rather than assess damage 106 initial ham radio reports from the capital of roseau on september 19 indicated total devastation with half the city flooded cars stranded

speed of 101 mph 162 km h  while winds up north in nearby baillif reached 92 mph 148 km h  121 along those regions the hurricane kicked up extremely rough seas with 20 ft 6 m waves 122 the combination of rough seas and winds was responsible for widespread structural damage and flooding throughout the archipelago especially from pointe-à-pitre along grand-terre island s southwestern coast to petit-bourg and the southern coasts on basse-terre island 74 aside from wind-related effects rainfall from maria was also significant in just a day the hurricane dropped nearly a month s worth of
