tropical wave that emerged off africa on september 22, matthew developed into a tropical storm just east of the lesser antilles on september 28. it became a hurricane north of venezuela and colombia on september 29, before undergoing explosive intensification ultimately reaching category 5 intensity on october 1 at just 13.4°n latitude – the lowest latitude ever recorded for a storm of this intensity in the atlantic basin breaking the record set by hurricane ivan in 2004. 1 matthew weakened slightly and fluctuated in intensity while making a northward turn toward the greater antilles remaining a strong category 4 hurricane as it made its first landfall over haiti s tiburon peninsula early on october 4, and then a second one in cuba later that day matthew weakened somewhat but

to the saffir–simpson scale a vigorous tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on september 22 and moved rapidly across the atlantic being monitored by the national hurricane center nhc for possible tropical cyclogenesis despite possessing tropical-storm winds as it approached the lesser antilles on september 27, the wave could not initially be classified as a tropical cyclone as reconnaissance aircraft could not find a closed center however by 12 00 utc on september 28, the wave developed a closed circulation while located near barbados hence becoming a tropical storm and was assigned the name matthew continuing westward under the influence of a mid-level ridge the storm steadily intensified to attain hurricane intensity by 18 00 utc on september 29. the effects of southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly abated late that day and matthew began a period of explosive intensification during a 24-hour period beginning at 00 00 utc on september 30, the cyclone s maximum winds more than doubled from 80 mph 130 km h to 165 mph 270 km h  making matthew a category 5 hurricane 1 the first since hurricane felix in 2007 3 the rate of intensification has only been exceeded a
