series writers steve young a writer for the late show with david letterman was brought in as a freelance writer to write the episode 4 the writers wanted to explore what made flanders tick and examine what made him act the way he does 4 the original idea came from george meyer who had also wanted an episode about flanders faith being tested 5 one of the key story points came from his friend jack handey a writer for saturday night live who wanted to do a sketch about a down-on-his-luck shoemaker who is visited by elves who help him but make very bad shoes likewise it inspired the idea that the neighbors would rebuild flanders house but do a bad job and provoke an outburst 5 writer john swartzwelder s animated likeness can be seen in a padded cell in reference to his reclusiveness a caricature of john swartzwelder can be seen shutting the door of a room in calmwood mental hospital 4 later in the episode during the scene where the townsfolk are welcoming ned back someone can be
