2017 atlantic hurricane and 2017–18 uk and ireland windstorm seasons hurricane ophelia known as storm ophelia in ireland and the united kingdom while extratropical was the easternmost atlantic major hurricane on record the tenth consecutive hurricane and the sixth major hurricane of the very active 2017 atlantic hurricane season ophelia had non-tropical origins from a decaying cold front on 6 october located within a favorable environment the storm steadily strengthened over the next two days drifting north and then southeastwards before becoming a hurricane on 11 october after becoming a category 2 hurricane and fluctuating in intensity for a day ophelia intensified into a major hurricane on 14 october south of the azores brushing the archipelago with high winds and heavy rainfall shortly after achieving peak intensity ophelia began weakening as it accelerated over progressively colder waters to its northeast towards ireland and great britain completing an extratropical transition early on 16 october ophelia became the second storm of the 2017–18 uk and ireland windstorm season early on 17 october the cyclone crossed the north sea and struck western norway with wind gusts up to 70 kilometres per hour 43 mph in rogaland county before weakening during the evening the system made additional landfalls in sweden and finland before dissipating over russia three deaths can be direcly attributed to ophelia all of which occurred in ireland the total losses from the storm are estimated at €1 billion us 1.18 billion  mostly from economic losses insured damage claims as of 24 october reached €6 million us 7 million in ireland and £5–10 million us 6.6–13.2 million in the united kingdom meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale on 6 october the united states national hurricane center nhc began monitoring the tail end of a decaying cold front for possible subtropical or tropical cyclogenesis 1 on the same day a circulation developed on the periphery of this front 1 soon afterwards a non-tropical low developed within the circulation and drifted to the southwest before becoming nearly stationary 2 the system began to acquire subtropical characteristics on the next day and the chances of development were raised to a high percentage of cyclogenesis 3 after a brief loss of organization and diminished convection due to moderate wind shear 4 the system continued to steadily organize and developed a well-defined circulation center early on 9 october as deep convection began to persist near the center 5 by 09 00 utc that day the convection had persisted long enough for the system to be classified as a tropical depression about 875 mi 1,410 km west-southwest of the azores and the storm was identified as tropical depression seventeen 6 7 a curved banding feature wrapped around the center as the satellite presentation improved leading to the upgrade to tropical storm ophelia six hours later 8 tropical depression seventeen organizing in the atlantic ocean on 9 october despite marginally warm sea surface temperatures of around 79 °f 26 °c  the effects of below-average temperatures aloft and low wind shear allowed ophelia to gradually strengthen with banding features becoming more prominent as it drifted northwards in an area of weak steering currents 9 in addition the large temperature contrast between the ocean surface and extremely cold temperatures in the upper atmosphere allowed the storm to continue strengthening despite it being over normally suboptimal ocean temperatures 10 a slight degradation of the structure of the storm resulted in some weakening early on 11 october 11 but this was short-lived as deep convection wrapped around the entire storm it was upgraded to a hurricane at 21 00 utc that day after a ragged eye developed becoming the record-tying tenth consecutive hurricane to form during the 2017 hurricane season ophelia was the fourth such occurrence since the 1878, 1886, and 1893 seasons 12 13 nb 1 afterwards ophelia steadily intensified as it became nearly stationary intensifying into a category 2 hurricane on the saffir–simpson scale on 12 october as the central dense overcast became more symmetric and the eye became better defined 14 the hurricane then weakened slightly the on next day as cloud tops warmed 15 only to quickly strengthen as the eye became much more defined and cloud tops cooled significantly due to outflow from a strong trough to the northeast the nhc upgraded the storm to a major hurricane category 3 or higher at 15 00 utc on 14 october the farthest east that a storm of such intensity had been observed in the satellite era 16 17 at the same time it attained its peak intensity with winds of 115 mph 185 km h and a minimum pressure of 960 millibars 28.35 inhg while located approximately 235 miles 375 km southeast of the azores after peaking in intensity increasing shear and dry air from an encroaching frontal boundary began to disrupt the core of the storm which caused ophelia to begin weakening early on 15 october as it began its extratropical transition with the eye collapsing 18 the process accelerated as ophelia became further embedded in the trough and ultimately the storm became extratropical at 03 00 utc on the next day 19 preparations and impact edit azores edit the portuguese institute of the sea and the atmosphere issued a red warning for heavy rainfall for the eastern group of the azores—são miguel santa maria and formigas—on 14 october from 17 59 utc to 23 59 utc 20 an orange gale warning was issued for the eastern group for the afternoon through night of 14–15 october 20 as well as a yellow alert for high seas 20 rainfall alerts were also issued

exceed that of storm darwin in 2014, which resulted in €111 million us 131 million in payouts 48 united kingdom edit saharan dust and smoke brought north by the former hurricane created hazy skies across parts of the united kingdom on 16 october resulting in an orange or red sun the met office in the united kingdom issued the first severe weather warnings for ophelia on 12 october referring to the hurricane as ex-ophelia in the context of the 2017–18 uk and ireland windstorm season 49 the severe weather warning initially issued on 12 october was a yellow weather warning for wind covering northern ireland northern england wales south west england and southern and western scotland valid between 12 00 and 23 55 bst on 15 october 49 the weather warning impact matrix warned of relatively severe impacts anticipated although with a low level of certainty so far in advance preventing the issuance of amber weather warnings initially 49 subsequently on 13 october a yellow severe weather warning for wind was issued for northern ireland southern scotland and northern england valid between 00 05 and 15 00 bst on 17 october on 15 october the weather warning for wind in northern ireland on 16 october was upgraded to an amber weather warning the arrival of ophelia brought saharan dust to parts of the united kingdom giving the sky an orange or yellow-sepia appearance and the sun a red or orange appearance 50 a strange burning smell was also reported across devon also attributed to the dust and smoke from forest fires in portugal and spain 51 winds up to 115 km h 71 mph were observed in orlock head county down at the height of the storm approximately 50,000 households lost power in northern ireland insurance claims from northern ireland wales and scotland are estimated to reach £5–10 million us 6.6–13.2 million  52 estonia edit in tallinn estonia black rain fell because ophelia brought smoke and the soot of fires to estonia from portugal as well as dust from the sahara desert report informs citing the estonian media we looked at photos from satellites and the finnish weather service confirmed that the smoke and soot of the fires in portugal and partly the dust from the sahara reached us meteorologist taimi paljak said 53 54 records edit hurricane ophelia was the easternmost major hurricane at category 3 intensity or higher ever observed in the north atlantic basin 16 17 hurricane ophelia s intensification into a hurricane also made the 2017 atlantic hurricane season the fourth such season to see 10 consecutive hurricanes after the 1878, 1886, and 1893 seasons as far as records go 12 13 nb 1 relation to climate change edit climate scientist reindert haarsma of the royal netherlands meteorological institute said that climate change is likely to cause europe to see more hurricanes like ophelia as the oceans get warmer although they were still comparing their model s results previously reported in 2013 with those from other climate centres 55 but ucd professor ray bates and ray mcgrath also of ucd argued that insofar as the influence of the sea surface temperature is concerned the exceptional strength of storm ophelia was due to natural variability rather than global warming 56
