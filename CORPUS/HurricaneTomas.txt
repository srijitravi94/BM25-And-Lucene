archipelago part of the 2010 atlantic hurricane season hurricane tomas was the latest recorded tropical cyclone on a calendar year to strike the windward islands the nineteenth named storm and twelfth hurricane of the 2010 atlantic hurricane season tomas developed from a tropical wave east of the windward islands on october 29. quickly intensifying into a hurricane it moved through the windward islands and passed over saint lucia after reaching category 2 status on the saffir-simpson scale tomas quickly weakened to a tropical storm in the central caribbean sea due to strong wind shear and dry air tomas later regained hurricane status as it reorganized near the windward passage throughout the hurricane s path 71 people are known to have been killed 14 of whom were in saint lucia monetary losses throughout the windward islands were estimated at us 588 million mainly in saint lucia in the wake of the storm in haiti flooding intensified an ongoing cholera outbreak indirectly causing more fatalities however direct impacts from the hurricane in haiti were less than anticipated overall damage from the storm was at least 741 million meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale a tropical wave or elongated low-pressure area exited the western coast of africa on october 24. 1 it moved hastily westward across the tropical atlantic at a comparatively low latitude becoming embedded within the intertropical convergence zone 2 3 during this time the wave s structure retained a vigorous appearance 1 the western portion contained scattered convection with strong thunderstorms as well as a broad area of rotating winds 3 on october 27, when the system was about 1,200 miles 1,940 km east-southeast of the windward islands the national hurricane center nhc noted favorable atmospheric conditions for tropical cyclogenesis namely light wind shear 4 the wave and its expansive convection amplified over the next two days featuring hints of spiraling rainbands 1 5 a hurricane hunters aircraft investigating the disturbance on october 29 observed a developing circulation with storm-force winds at sea level 6 in light of those features the nhc estimated that the system became a tropical depression by 06 00 utc that day about 460 mi 740 km southeast of barbados and further upgraded it to tropical storm tomas six hours later 1 7 on its inception tomas turned toward the northwest and decelerated 1 within a region of low wind shear and high tropical moisture—two of the prime prerequisites of rapid intensification a misalignment between the cyclone s low- and upper-level circulations impeded this strengthening potential however and at that time the nhc did not expect tomas to attain hurricane status until 36 to 48 hours later 7 steered along high pressure to its north the storm retraced slightly west-northwestward on its approach to the windward islands 1 8 despite the prior forecasts of moderated strengthening tomas winds sharply increased to 60 mph 95 km h by late october 29 9 moreover the outflow aloft became well established in all quadrants as the convection consolidated into a prominent rain band 10 the center of the intensifying storm crossed southern barbados the next morning around 09 00 utc 1 radar images from martinique soon revealed the formation of an eye 8 tomas attained hurricane status a couple of hours later about 35 miles 55 km east of saint vincent and the grenadines after hurricane hunters recorded surface winds of 75 mph 120 km h  by that time the eye measured 35–46 mi 56–74 km in diameter 11 a weakening tropical storm tomas over the atlantic on november 6 tomas continued to strengthen through october 30 as it moved generally west- to west-northwestward around 20 00 utc the eye traversed the northern shores of saint vincent while the northernmost ring of the severest winds skirted saint lucia 1 subsequent reports from hurricane hunters and post-storm reanalysis indicated that tomas had reached a peak intensity with wind speeds of 100 mph 155 km h and a minimum pressure of 982 mbar hpa 29.00 inhg during its trek across the islands making it a category 2 on the saffir–simpson hurricane scale 1 12 although the nhc noted the potential for tomas to become a major hurricane the agency conversely observed that the hurricane had begun to suffer from southwesterly wind shear which computer models forecast to increase in the long term 12 on october 31, a combination of this shear and pockets of dry air dispersed the convection surrounding the eye initiating a weakening trend 13 tomas diminished to a tropical storm early on november 1, when the strongest thunderstorms became dislocated from the low-level wind vortex by more than 115 mi 185 km  1 14 tomas meandered slightly south of west for a while passing north of the abc islands overnight 1 15 although the upper wind regime relaxed into the next day with an area of deep convection briefly reblossoming near tomas center 15 the shear appeared to have already taken its toll on the storm with an increasingly diffuse and elongated structure tomas further weakened to a tropical depression at 00 00 utc november 3, about 325 miles 520 km southeast of kingston jamaica 1 16 following its deterioration tomas diverged toward the northwest over the central caribbean 1 the circulation lost further definition adjoining a wide stretch of low pressures spanning the western caribbean a hurricane hunters mission to determine whether tomas retained its status as a tropical cyclone found that the mean low-level circulation had reformed to the northeast of the previous center tomas reattained tropical storm strength late on november 3, 17 18 and although the low- and mid-level centers were initially nonaligned slow restrengthening ensued into the next day 19 tomas turned northward ahead of an unseasonably strong deep-layered trough circumnavigating the western periphery of the subtropical ridge 1 20 over a six-hour period the cyclone s core thunderstorm activity became much more concentrated with a corresponding quick drop in central pressure 21 while turning northeastward into the windward passage tomas regained hurricane status around 0600 utc on november 5, just 36 miles 58 km west-southwest of the western tip of haiti 1 22 over the course of november 5, the hurricane accelerated northeastward in response to the approaching trough passing right between eastern cuba and western haiti due to its proximity to land the convection became disrupted near the center 23 tomas reweakened to a tropical storm near the turks and caicos islands during a spell of moderate shear on november 6. 1 after moving through that island nation tomas briefly became a hurricane for a final time before hostile wind shear from the nearby trough fully began to take effect in conjunction with increasingly dry air the cyclone steadily weakened to a tropical storm on november 7. tomas lost its tropical characteristics the next day though it retained gale-force winds as an extratropical cyclone it turned sharply eastward before curving northward accelerated by a broad cyclonic steering flow over the western atlantic the next couple of days the thomas extratropical remnant subsequently raced off into the north atlantic until it was absorbed by another extratropical system a few hundred miles south of newfoundland canada on november 11. 1 preparations edit prior to the development of tomas the nhc noted the potential for heavy rainfall and strong wind gusts to spread across the windward islands venezuela and northern guyana due to the tropical wave of which later developed into hurricane tomas 24 upon development of tropical storm tomas most of the windward islands were put under a tropical storm warning issued by their respective governments a tropical storm watch was also issued for dominica 25 six hours later as tomas was nearly a hurricane the tropical storm warning was replaced by a hurricane warning in barbados st vincent and the grenadines st lucia and martinique the tropical storm watch in dominica was also upgraded to a tropical storm warning 26 in barbados people evacuated to schools and shelters for safety during the storm 27 on st lucia the government closed the island s two airports and ordered the closure of all businesses additionally a large creole festival was canceled due to the storm 28 officials in trinidad and tobago closed beaches across the country 29 in st vincent the national emergency management organization nemo issued advisories that a tropical system was approaching the country the rapid intensification of tomas caught many citizens in st vincent off guard early on october 30, the prime minister addressed the nation and informed the country of the situation it was facing following the west-southwesterly motion of the storm swells generated by tomas produced breaking waves on coastal sections of the abc islands during the morning of november 1. consequently a small craft advisory was issued at 1415 utc for all three islands 30 in addition a state of severe weather was declared for bonaire and curaçao during the passage of tomas 31 in haiti the country which was devastated earlier in the year from a deadly january 12 earthquake government officials began preparing for possible impact from tomas by october 30. one united nations spokesperson remarked that a hurricane strike would be the last thing haiti needs  27 the haitian government issued an orange storm alert one level short of the highest state of alert and warned for the possibility of winds thunderstorms and flooding 28 impact edit impact by country or region county region deaths damage source barbados 0 none

100 km h  which damaged homes and power lines on the island 34 there were also reports of blown off roofs impassable roads and uprooted trees 35 later a station on saint lucia recorded sustained winds of 48 mph 77 km h  with gusts to 69 mph 110 km h  36 there was widespread damage to homes and power lines 37 the winds destroyed the roof of a hospital and a school with several trees and power lines blown down 28 additionally a station on martinique reported sustained winds of 72 mph 115 km h  with gusts to 108 mph 173 km h  38 on saint vincent there were no deaths but two persons sustained serious injuries while trying to effect repairs to house roofs and two persons were reported missing the two persons reported missing were found on november 1, off the island of balliceaux the national emergency management organization nemo declared all areas from park hill to owia on the eastern side and all areas from belle isle to fitz hughes on the western side disaster zones it was also reported that the agriculture sector sustained over us 25 million ec 67 million worth of damage over 1200 people were forced to seek refuge in hurricane shelters across st vincent about 600 houses lost their roofs a lot of downed power lines trees and landslides made some roads impassable but nemo the bridges roads and general services authority bragsa and the st vincent electricity services company vinlec were able to clear the main road by the november 1. saint lucia arguably had sustained the worst damage from the storm overall throughout saint lucia severe flooding and mudslides resulted in at least 7 fatalities confirmed by the chief medical officer according to a government minister several other people were missing and buried in landslides 39 by the morning of november 2, two more fatalities were confirmed on the island 40 other caribbean islands edit tropical storm tomas reorganizing over the caribbean sea on november 4 while passing the windward islands into the caribbean sea tomas produced strong winds and heavy rainfall on isla aves located off the northern coast of venezuela 27 although the storm did not directly strike the abc islands one of its outer rainbands stalled over the region and intensified during the night of november 1 to november 2. curaçao experienced its most extreme rain event in 40 years as many as 10.4 inches 265 mm were recorded over a 24-hour period in the eastern part of the island 41 the majority of the rain fell overnight in a heavy downpour accompanied by a severe thunderstorm that triggered large-scale power tv and radio outages 42 43 lightning strikes sparked three large fires in a major oil refinery in willemstad the fires inflicted severe damage to several tanks estimated at us 10 million 44 flights from curaçao international airport were delayed due to the hazardous conditions 45 following hours of heavy rainfall widespread floods made most roads in the region impassable with dozens of cars swept away or stranded 42 the rains filled dams and overwhelmed drains causing them to overflow and exacerbating the flooding 46 the towns of saliña brievengat and mahaai were among the hardest hit hundreds of homes gardens and businesses were inundated 42 47 at the height of the rainstorm a rescue worker assisting in the evacuation of a hospital was killed by the collapse of a wall an elderly man suffering a heart attack drowned while unable to exit his flooded car 48 overall curaçao suffered some of its worst flooding in history insured losses across the island exceeded naƒ110 million us 63 million  though total damage costs from tomas were estimated at naƒ200 million us 115 million  49 damage on the other two islands was much more limited parts of bonaire experienced heavy but brief periods of rain with a maximum of 3 inches 75 mm at flamingo international airport causing localized flooding of property on aruba some thunder and moderate rainfall occurred without significant consequences 41 all schools across the islands were closed on november 2 and 3 as a result of the storm 50 greater antilles edit flooding from tomas in port-au-prince haiti on november 6 after days of anticipation tomas arrived just offshore in haiti on the morning of november 5. the storm intensified while brushing the disaster-weary nation reattaining hurricane strength near the westernmost tip of haiti torrential rains and tropical storm force winds buffeted the entire region within hours of the storm s arrival flooding began to occur in earthquake-ravaged port-au-prince one of the largest refugee camps set up near the ruins of the capitol building was flooded following heavy rains 51 by the evening of november 8, 20 people had been confirmed dead 7 others were listed as missing and more than 30,000 people were in shelters 52 health workers also feared damage related to tomas on the island could exacerbate the ongoing cholera outbreak 53 54 55 hurricane tomas as it tracks across the greater antilles on november 5 tomas passed just to the east of cuba hours later but no significant damage was reported on the island 56 as the outer bands of hurricane tomas began to impact cuba aero caribbean flight 883, an atr-72-212 aircraft crashed near the town of guasimal in sancti spíritus province all 68 people on board the plane were killed on impact although the plane was the last to leave the airport in santiago de cuba before it closed due to tomas it is unknown what role if any the storm played in the crash 57 58 following a review of the crash it was determined that severe ice accumulation at an altitude of 20,000 ft 6,100 m  along with errors by the crew caused the incident 59 elsewhere edit hurricane tomas narrowly missed the turks and caicos sparing the islands a direct hit and causing only minor flooding 60 aftermath edit estimates place the cost of damage in barbados at bds 17 million us 8.5 million  61 throughout the northern part of st vincent the entire banana crop was lost press reports from the prime minister revealed that nearly every banana tree had been downed during the storm the country s banana crop is a major source of income and jobs accounting for roughly 60 of the workforce and 50 of the merchandise exported 62 damage from the storm on trinidad and tobago amounted to tt 4 million us 629,000  63 losses in barbados reached bds 17 million us 8.4 million  64 the government of st lucia stated that damage from the storm could exceed us 100 million 65 by november 5, the prime minister stated that damage from tomas was roughly ec 1.3 billion 500 million usd  five times higher than initially stated 66 retirement edit see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names due to the extent of damage across the caribbean the name tomas was retired on march 16, 2011 by the world meteorological organization during their 33rd hurricane committee and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane it was replaced with tobias for the 2016 hurricane season 67 however the name was unused in 2016 season so it may be used in the 2022 season
