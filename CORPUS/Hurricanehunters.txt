to gather weather data currently the us organizations that fly these missions are the united states air force reserve s 53d weather reconnaissance squadron and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s hurricane hunters such missions have also been flown by navy units and other air force and noaa units manned flights into hurricanes began in 1943 when on a bet pilot-trainer colonel joseph duckworth flew a single-engine plane into a category 1 storm near galveston texas since then six military weather reconnaissance planes have gone down at a cost of fifty-three lives 1 2 3 in one such incident six of the seven crew members of the navy pb4y-2 buno 59415 were killed on october 1, 1945 when their plane went down in a category 1 typhoon over the south china sea 4 before satellites were used to find storms military aircraft flew routine weather reconnaissance tracks to detect formation of tropical cyclones today satellites have improved weather forecasters ability to detect signs of such cyclones before they form yet they cannot determine the interior barometric pressure of a hurricane nor provide accurate wind speed information--data needed to accurately predict hurricane development and movement units edit usafr 53d wrs edit main article 53d weather reconnaissance squadron the air force reserve 53d weather reconnaissance squadron the world s only operational military weather reconnaissance unit is based at keesler air force base in biloxi mississippi most weather recon flights originate there the term hurricane hunters was first applied to its missions in 1946. the usafr hurricane hunters fly weather missions in an area midway through the atlantic ocean to the hawaiian islands and have on occasion flown into typhoons in the pacific ocean and gathered data in winter storms the 53d wrs hurricane hunters operate ten lockheed wc-130j aircraft which fly directly into hurricanes typically penetrating the hurricane s eye several times per mission at altitudes between 500 feet 150 m and 10,000 feet 3,000 m  noaa hurricane hunters edit main article noaa hurricane hunters the civilian and noaa corps crew members of the noaa hurricane hunters until recently based at the aircraft operations center at macdill afb in tampa florida mainly perform surveillance research and reconnaissance with highly instrumented aircraft including airborne doppler weather radar measurements in both atlantic and pacific storms in june 2017 1 2  the hunters moved in to a new facility at lakeland linder airport in lakeland florida after being at macdill since 1993. they fly two lockheed wp-3d orion aircraft heavily instrumented flying laboratories modified to take atmospheric and radar measurements within tropical cyclones and winter storms and a g-iv gulfstream high-altitude jet above 41,000 feet 12 km to document upper- and lower-level winds that affect cyclone movement the computer models that forecast hurricane tracks and intensity mainly use g-iv dropsonde data collected day and night in storms affecting the united states history edit view of the eyewall of hurricane katrina taken on august 28, 2005, by a noaa p-3 among the types of aircraft that have been used to investigate hurricanes are an instrumented lockheed u-2 flown in hurricane ginny during the 1963 atlantic hurricane season other types include the a-20 havoc 1944 b-24 1944–1945 b-17 1945–1947 b-25 1946–1947 b-29 1946–1947 wb-29 1951–1956 wb-50 1956–1963 wb-47 1963–1969 wc-121n 1954–1973 wc-130a,b,e,h 1965–2012 the idea of aircraft reconnaissance of hurricane storm trackers was put forth by captain w l farnsworth of the galveston commercial association in the early 1930s supported by the united states weather bureau the storm patrol bill passed both the united states senate and united states house of representatives on june 15, 1936. 5 1943 surprise hurricane edit the 1943 surprise hurricane which struck houston texas during world war ii marked the first intentional meteorological flight into a hurricane it started with a bet that summer british pilots were being trained in instrument flying at bryan field when they saw that the americans were evacuating their at-6 texan trainers in the face of the storm they began questioning the construction of the aircraft lead instructor colonel joe duckworth took one of the trainers out and flew it straight into the eye of the storm after he returned safely with navigator lt ralph o hair the base s weather officer lt william jones-burdick took over the navigator s seat and duckworth flew into the storm a second time this flight showed that hurricane reconnaissance flights were possible and further flights continued occasionally in 1946, the moniker hurricane hunters was first used and the air force and now air force reserve have used it ever since vw-4 edit lockheed wp-3a orion weather reconnaissance aircraft of vw-4 squadron at its nas jacksonville florida base in 1974 the united states navy s vw-4 wearecoron four weather reconnaissance squadron four hurricane hunters was the seventh u.s navy squadron dedicated to weather reconnaissance they flew several types of aircraft but the wc-121n willy victor was the aircraft most often associated with flying into the eye of the storm the squadron operated wc-121s between late 1954 and 1972. 6 vw-4 lost one aircraft and crew in a penetration of hurricane janet 7 and another to severe damage in a storm but the severely damaged willy victor mh-1 brought her crew home though it never flew again during 1973–1975 vw-4 operated the turbine-propeller lockheed wp-3a orion swan 38 edit main article swan 38 in 1974, a newly converted wc-130 serial number 65-0965 was transferred to the 54th weather reconnaissance squadron the typhoon chasers  at andersen air force base on guam the aircraft was sent to investigate typhoon bess the crew departed clark air base in the philippines with the callsign swan 38  radio contact with the aircraft was lost on 12 october 1974, apparently as the aircraft was heading into the typhoon s eye to make a second position fix there were no radio transmissions indicating an emergency on board and search teams could not locate the aircraft or its crew all six crew members were listed as killed in action 8 swan 38 was the only wc-130 lost in a storm hurricane katrina edit the landfall of hurricane katrina on 29 august 2005 devastated keesler air force base home of the 53d wrs the equipment and personnel of the squadron were flying out of dobbins air reserve base near atlanta despite heavy losses clarification needed the squadron never missed a mission from the national hurricane center the 53d has since returned to keesler in popular culture edit a reality television series featuring the usafr 53d entitled hurricane hunters debuted on the weather channel in july 2012. 9
