active headquarters geneva switzerland head chair hoesung lee website www.ipcc.ch the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc is a scientific and intergovernmental body under the auspices of the united nations 1 2 set up at the request of member governments dedicated to the task of providing the world with an objective scientific view of climate change and its political and economic impacts 3 it was first established in 1988 by two united nations organizations the world meteorological organization wmo and the united nations environment programme unep  and later endorsed by the united nations general assembly through resolution 43 53. membership of the ipcc is open to all members of the wmo and unep 4 the ipcc produces reports that support the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc  which is the main international treaty on climate change 5 6 the ultimate objective of the unfccc is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic i.e. human-induced interference with the climate system  5 ipcc reports cover the scientific technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation 6 the ipcc does not carry out its own original research nor does it do the work of monitoring climate or related phenomena itself the ipcc bases its assessment on the published literature which includes peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed sources 7 thousands of scientists and other experts contribute on a voluntary basis without payment from the ipcc 8 to writing and reviewing reports which are then reviewed by governments ipcc reports contain a summary for policymakers  which is subject to line-by-line approval by delegates from all participating governments typically this involves the governments of more than 120 countries 9 the ipcc provides an internationally accepted authority on climate change 10 producing reports which have the agreement of leading climate scientists and the consensus of participating governments the 2007 nobel peace prize was shared in equal parts between the ipcc and al gore 11 origins and aims edit the ipcc developed from an international scientific body the advisory group on greenhouse gases set up in 1985 by the international council of scientific unions the united nations environment programme unep  and the world meteorological organization wmo to provide recommendations based on current research this small group of scientists lacked the resources to cover the increasingly complex interdisciplinary nature of climate science the united states environmental protection agency and state department wanted an international convention to agree restrictions on greenhouse gases and the conservative reagan administration was concerned about unrestrained influence from independent scientists or from united nations bodies including unep and the wmo the u.s government was the main force in forming the ipcc as an autonomous intergovernmental body in which scientists took part both as experts on the science and as official representatives of their governments to produce reports which had the firm backing of all the leading scientists worldwide researching the topic and which then had to gain consensus agreement from every one of the participating governments in this way it was formed as a hybrid between a scientific body and an intergovernmental political organisation 3 the principles that the ipcc operates under 12 are set out in the relevant wmo executive council and unep governing council resolutions and decisions as well as on actions in support of the unfccc process 13 the aims of the ipcc are to assess scientific information relevant to 6 human-induced climate change the impacts of human-induced climate change options for adaptation and mitigation organization edit korean economist hoesung lee has been the chair of the ipcc since october 8, 2015, following the election of the new ipcc bureau 14 before this election the ipcc was led by his vice-chair ismail el gizouli who was designated acting chair after the resignation of rajendra k pachauri in february 2015. 15 the previous chairs were rajendra k pachauri elected in may 2002 robert watson in 1997 and bert bolin in 1988. 16 the chair is assisted by an elected bureau including vice-chairs working group co-chairs and a secretariat the ipcc panel is composed of representatives appointed by governments and organizations participation of delegates with appropriate expertise is encouraged plenary sessions of the ipcc and ipcc working groups are held at the level of government representatives non governmental and intergovernmental organizations may be allowed to attend as observers sessions of the ipcc bureau workshops expert and lead authors meetings are by invitation only 17 attendance at the 2003 meeting included 350 government officials and climate change experts after the opening ceremonies closed plenary sessions were held 18 the meeting report 19 states there were 322 persons in attendance at sessions with about seven-eighths of participants being from governmental organizations 19 there are several major groups ipcc panel meets in plenary session about once a year and controls the organization s structure procedures and work program the panel is the ipcc corporate entity 20 chair elected by the panel secretariat oversees and manages all activities supported by unep and wmo bureau elected by the panel chaired by the chair 30 members include ipcc vice-chairs co-chairs and vice-chairs of working groups and task force 21 working groups each has two co-chairs one from the developed and one from developing world and a technical support unit working group i assesses scientific aspects of the climate system and climate change co-chairs valérie masson-delmotte and panmao zhai 22 working group ii assesses vulnerability of socio-economic and natural systems to climate change consequences and adaptation options co-chairs hans-otto pörtner and debra roberts 22 working group iii assesses options for limiting greenhouse gas emissions and otherwise mitigating climate change co-chairs priyadarshi r shukla and jim skea 22 task force on national greenhouse gas inventories 20 the ipcc receives funding through the ipcc trust fund established in 1989 by the united nations environment programme unep and the world meteorological organization wmo  costs of the secretary and of housing the secretariat are provided by the wmo while unep meets the cost of the depute secretary annual cash contributions to the trust fund are made by the wmo by unep and by ipcc members the scale of payments is determined by the ipcc panel which is also responsible for considering and adopting by consensus the annual budget the organisation is required to comply with the financial regulations and rules of the wmo 23 assessment reports edit ipcc assessment reports first 1990 1992 sup second 1995 third 2001 fourth 2007 fifth 2014 sixth 2022 unfccc wmo unep the ipcc has published five comprehensive assessment reports reviewing the latest climate science 24 as well as a number of special reports on particular topics these reports are prepared by teams of relevant researchers selected by the bureau from government nominations drafts of these reports are made available for comment in open review processes to which anyone may contribute citation needed the ipcc published its first assessment report in 1990, a supplementary report in 1992, a second assessment report sar in 1995, a third assessment report tar in 2001, a fourth assessment report ar4 in 2007 25 and a fifth assessment report ar5 in 2014. each assessment report is in three volumes corresponding to working groups i ii and iii unqualified the ipcc report is often used to mean the working group i report which covers the basic science of climate change scope and preparation of the reports edit the ipcc does not carry out research nor does it monitor climate related data lead authors of ipcc reports assess the available information about climate change based on published sources 26 27 according to ipcc guidelines authors should give priority to peer-reviewed sources 26 authors may refer to non-peer-reviewed sources the grey literature  provided that they are of sufficient quality 26 examples of non-peer-reviewed sources include model results reports from government agencies and non-governmental organizations and industry journals 7 each subsequent ipcc report notes areas where the science has improved since the previous report and also notes areas where further research is required there are generally three stages in the review process 28 expert review 6–8 weeks government expert review government review of summaries for policymakers overview chapters synthesis report review comments are in an open archive for at least five years there are several types of endorsement which documents receive approval material has been subjected to detailed line by line discussion and agreement working group summaries for policymakers are approved by their working groups synthesis report summary for policymakers is approved by panel adoption endorsed section by section and not line by line  panel adopts overview chapters of methodology reports panel adopts ipcc synthesis report acceptance not been subject to line by line discussion and agreement but presents a comprehensive objective and balanced view of the subject matter working groups accept their reports task force reports are accepted by the panel working group summaries for policymakers are accepted by the panel after group approval the panel is responsible for the ipcc and its endorsement of reports allows it to ensure they meet ipcc standards there have been a range of commentaries on the ipcc s procedures examples of which are discussed later in the article see also ipcc summary for policymakers  some of these comments have been supportive 29 while others have been critical 30 some commentators have suggested changes to the ipcc s procedures 31 authors edit this article needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced

report the ipcc first assessment report was completed in 1990, and served as the basis of the unfccc the executive summary of the wg i summary for policymakers report says they are certain that emissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases resulting on average in an additional warming of the earth s surface they calculate with confidence that co2 has been responsible for over half the enhanced greenhouse effect they predict that under a business as usual bau scenario global mean temperature will increase by about 0.3 °c per decade during the 21st century they judge that global mean surface air temperature has increased by 0.3 to 0.6 °c over the last 100 years broadly consistent with prediction of climate models but also of the same magnitude as natural climate variability the unequivocal detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect is not likely for a decade or more supplementary report of 1992 edit the 1992 supplementary report was an update requested in the context of the negotiations on the unfccc at the earth summit united nations conference on environment and development in rio de janeiro in 1992. the major conclusion was that research since 1990 did not affect our fundamental understanding of the science of the greenhouse effect and either confirm or do not justify alteration of the major conclusions of the first ipcc scientific assessment  it noted that transient time-dependent simulations which had been very preliminary in the far were now improved but did not include aerosol or ozone changes second assessment report edit main article ipcc second assessment report climate change 1995, the ipcc second assessment report sar  was finished in 1996. it is split into four parts a synthesis to help interpret unfccc article 2. the science of climate change wg i impacts adaptations and mitigation of climate change wg ii economic and social dimensions of climate change wg iii each of the last three parts was completed by a separate working group and each has a summary for policymakers spm that represents a consensus of national representatives the spm of the wg i report contains headings greenhouse gas concentrations have continued to increase anthropogenic aerosols tend to produce negative radiative forcings climate has changed over the past century air temperature has increased by between 0.3 and 0.6 °c since the late 19th century this estimate has not significantly changed since the 1990 report  the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate considerable progress since the 1990 report in distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic influences on climate because of including aerosols coupled models pattern-based studies climate is expected to continue to change in the future increasing realism of simulations increases confidence important uncertainties remain but are taken into account in the range of model projections there are still many uncertainties estimates of future emissions and biogeochemical cycling models instrument data for model testing assessment of variability and detection studies third assessment report edit main article ipcc third assessment report the third assessment report tar was completed in 2001 and consists of four reports three of them from its working groups working group i the scientific basis 32 working group ii impacts adaptation and vulnerability 33 working group iii mitigation 34 synthesis report 35 a number of the tar s conclusions are given quantitative estimates of how probable it is that they are correct e.g. greater than 66 probability of being correct 36 these are bayesian probabilities which are based on an expert assessment of all the available evidence 37 38 robust findings of the tar synthesis report include observations show earth s surface is warming globally 1990s very likely warmest decade in instrumental record  39 atmospheric concentrations of anthropogenic i.e. human-emitted greenhouse gases have increased substantially 39 since the mid-20th century most of the observed warming is likely greater than 66 probability based on expert judgement 36 due to human activities 39 projections based on the special report on emissions scenarios suggest warming over the 21st century at a more rapid rate than that experienced for at least the last 10,000 years 39 projected climate change will have beneficial and adverse effects on both environmental and socio-economic systems but the larger the changes and the rate of change in climate the more the adverse effects predominate 39 ecosystems and species are vulnerable to climate change and other stresses as illustrated by observed impacts of recent regional temperature changes and some will be irreversibly damaged or lost 39 greenhouse gas emission reduction mitigation actions would lessen the pressures on natural and human systems from climate change 39 adaptation to the effects of climate change has the potential to reduce adverse effects of climate change and can often produce immediate ancillary benefits but will not prevent all damages 39 an example of adaptation to climate change is building levees in response to sea level rise 40 comments on the tar edit in 2001, 16 national science academies issued a joint statement on climate change 41 the joint statement was made by the australian academy of science the royal flemish academy of belgium for science and the arts the brazilian academy of sciences the royal society of canada the caribbean academy of sciences the chinese academy of sciences the french academy of sciences the german academy of natural scientists leopoldina the indian national science academy the indonesian academy of sciences the royal irish academy accademia nazionale dei lincei italy  the academy of sciences malaysia the academy council of the royal society of new zealand the royal swedish academy of sciences and the royal society uk  41 the statement also published as an editorial in the journal science stated we support the tar s conclusion that it is at least 90 certain that temperatures will continue to rise with average global surface temperature projected to increase by between 1.4 and 5.8 °c above 1990 levels by 2100  42 the tar has also been endorsed by the canadian foundation for climate and atmospheric sciences 43 canadian meteorological and oceanographic society 44 and european geosciences union 45 refer to endorsements of the ipcc  in 2001, the us national research council us nrc 46 produced a report that assessed working group i s wgi contribution to the tar us nrc 2001 47 generally agrees with the wgi assessment and describes the full wgi report as an admirable summary of research activities in climate science  48 ipcc author richard lindzen has made a number of criticisms of the tar 49 among his criticisms lindzen has stated that the wgi summary for policymakers spm does not faithfully summarize the full wgi report 49 for example lindzen states that the spm understates the uncertainty associated with climate models 49 john houghton who was a co-chair of tar wgi 50 has responded to lindzen s criticisms of the spm 51 houghton has stressed that the spm is agreed upon by delegates from many of the world s governments and that any changes to the spm must be supported by scientific evidence 51 ipcc author kevin trenberth has also commented on the wgi spm 52 trenberth has stated that during the drafting of the wgi spm some government delegations attempted to blunt and perhaps obfuscate the messages in the report  52 however trenberth concludes that the spm is a reasonably balanced summary  52 us nrc 2001 53 concluded that the wgi spm and technical summary are consistent with the full wgi report us nrc 2001 48 stated . the full wgi report is adequately summarized in the technical summary the full wgi report and its technical summary are not specifically directed at policy the summary for policymakers reflects less emphasis on communicating the basis for uncertainty and a stronger emphasis on areas of major concern associated with human-induced climate change this change in emphasis appears to be the result of a summary process in which scientists work with policy makers on the document written responses from u.s coordinating and lead scientific authors to the committee indicate however that a no changes were made without the consent of the convening lead authors this group represents a fraction of the lead and contributing authors and b most changes that did occur lacked significant impact fourth assessment report edit main article ipcc fourth assessment report the fourth assessment report ar4 was published in 2007. 54 like previous assessment reports it consists of four reports working group i the physical science basis working group ii impacts adaptation and vulnerability working group iii mitigation synthesis report people from over 130 countries contributed to the ipcc fourth assessment report which took 6 years to produce 54 contributors to ar4 included more than 2500 scientific expert reviewers more than 800 contributing authors and more than 450 lead authors 54 robust findings of the synthesis report include 55 warming of the climate system is unequivocal as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level  56 most of the global average warming over the past 50 years is very likely greater than 90 probability based on expert judgement 57 due to human activities 56 impacts of climate change will very likely increase due to increased frequencies and intensities of some extreme weather events  58 anthropogenic warming and sea level rise would continue for centuries even if ghg emissions were to be reduced sufficiently for ghg concentrations to stabilise due to the time scales associated with climate processes and feedbacks  58 stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations is discussed in climate change mitigation some planned adaptation of human activities is occurring now more extensive adaptation is required to reduce vulnerability to climate change  59 unmitigated climate change would in the long term be likely to exceed the capacity of natural managed and human systems to adapt  59 many impacts of climate change can be reduced delayed or avoided by mitigation  59 global warming projections from ar4 60 are shown below the projections apply to the end of the 21st century 2090–99  relative to temperatures at the end of the 20th century 1980–99  add 0.7 °c to projections to make them relative to pre-industrial levels instead of 1980–99 61 descriptions of the greenhouse gas emissions scenarios can be found in special report on emissions scenarios ar4 global warming projections 60 emissions scenario best estimate °c likely range °c b1 1.8 1.1 – 2.9 a1t 2.4 1.4 – 3.8 b2 2.4 1.4 – 3.8 a1b 2.8 1.7 – 4.4 a2 3.4 2.0 – 5.4 a1fi 4.0 2.4 – 6.4 likely means greater than 66 probability of being correct based on expert judgement 57 response to ar4 edit several science academies have referred to and or reiterated some of the conclusions of ar4 these include joint-statements made in 2007, 62 2008 63 and 2009 64 by the science academies of brazil china india mexico south africa and the g8 nations the g8 5  publications by the australian academy of science 65 a joint-statement made in 2007 by the network of african science academies 66 a statement made in 2010 by the inter academy medical panel 67 this statement has been signed by 43 scientific academies a the netherlands environmental assessment agency pbl et al. 2009 68 2010 69 has carried out two reviews of ar4 these reviews are generally supportive of ar4 s conclusions 70 71 pbl 2010 71 make some recommendations to improve the ipcc process a literature assessment by the us national research council us nrc 2010 72 concludes climate change is occurring is caused largely by human activities and poses significant risks for—and in many cases is already affecting—a broad range of human and natural systems emphasis in original text  . this conclusion is based on a substantial array of scientific evidence including recent work and is consistent with the conclusions of recent assessments by the u.s global change research program .  the intergovernmental panel on climate change’s fourth assessment report .  and other assessments of the state of scientific knowledge on climate change some errors have been found in the ipcc ar4 working group ii report two errors include the melting of himalayan glaciers see later section  and dutch land area that is below sea level 73 fifth assessment report edit main article ipcc fifth assessment report the ipcc s fifth assessment report ar5 was completed in 2014. 74 ar5 followed the same general format as of ar4 with three working group reports and a synthesis report 74 the working group i report wg1 was published in september 2013. 74 conclusions of ar5 are summarized below working group i warming of the climate system is unequivocal and since the 1950s many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia  75 atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide have increased to levels unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years  76 human influence on the climate system is clear 77 it is extremely likely 95-100 probability 78 that human influence was the dominant cause of global warming between 1951-2010 77 working group ii increasing magnitudes of global warming increase the likelihood of severe pervasive and irreversible impacts 79 a first step towards adaptation to future climate change is reducing vulnerability and exposure to present climate variability 80 the overall risks of climate change impacts can be reduced by limiting the rate and magnitude of climate change 79 working group iii without new policies to mitigate climate change projections suggest an increase in global mean temperature in 2100 of 3.7 to 4.8 °c relative to pre-industrial levels median values the range is 2.5 to 7.8 °c including climate uncertainty  81 the current trajectory of global greenhouse gas emissions is not consistent with limiting global warming to below 1.5 or 2 °c relative to pre-industrial levels 82 pledges made as part of the cancún agreements are broadly consistent with cost-effective scenarios that give a likely chance 66-100 probability of limiting global warming in 2100 to below 3 °c relative to pre-industrial levels 83 representative concentration pathways edit projections in ar5 are based on representative concentration pathways rcps  84 the rcps are consistent with a wide range of possible changes in future anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions projected changes in global mean surface temperature and sea level are given in the main rcp article special reports edit in addition to climate assessment reports the ipcc is publishing special reports on specific topics the preparation and approval process for all ipcc special reports follows the same procedures as for ipcc assessment reports in the year 2011 two ipcc special report were finalized the special report on renewable energy sources and climate change mitigation srren and the special report on managing risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation srex  both special reports were requested by governments 85 special report on emissions scenarios sres edit the special report on emissions scenarios sres is a report by the ipcc which was published in 2000. 86 the sres contains scenarios of future changes in emissions of greenhouse gases and sulfur dioxide 87 one of the uses of the sres scenarios is to project future changes in climate e.g. changes in global mean temperature the sres scenarios were used in the ipcc s third 88 and fourth assessment reports 89 the sres scenarios are baseline or reference scenarios which means that they do not take into account any current or future measures to limit greenhouse gas ghg emissions e.g. the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change  90 sres emissions projections are broadly comparable in range to the baseline projections that have been developed by the scientific community 91 comments on the sres edit there have been a number of comments on the sres parson et al 2007 92 stated that the sres represented a substantial advance from prior scenarios  at the same time there have been criticisms of the sres 93 the most prominently publicized criticism of sres focused on the fact that all but one of the participating models compared gross domestic product gdp across regions using market exchange rates mer  instead of the more correct purchasing-power parity ppp approach 94 this criticism is discussed in the main sres article special report on renewable energy sources and climate change mitigation srren edit this report assesses existing literature on renewable energy commercialisation for the mitigation of climate change it was published in 2012 and covers the six most important renewable energy technologies as well as their integration into present and future energy systems it also takes into consideration the environmental and social consequences associated with these technologies the cost and strategies to overcome technical as well as non-technical obstacles to their application and diffusion the full report in pdf form is found here http www.ipcc.ch pdf special-reports srren srren full report.pdf more than 130 authors from all over the world contributed to the preparation of ipcc special report on renewable energy sources and climate change mitigation srren on a voluntary basis – not to mention more than 100 scientists who served as contributing authors 85 95 special report on managing the risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation srex edit the report was published in 2012. it assesses the effect that climate change has on the threat of natural disasters and how nations can better manage an expected change in the frequency of occurrence and intensity of severe weather patterns it aims to become a resource for decision-makers to prepare more effectively for managing the risks of these events a potentially important area for consideration is also the detection of trends in extreme events and the attribution of these trends to human influence the full report 594 pages in pdf form may be found here 1 more than 80 authors 19 review editors and more than 100 contributing authors from all over the world contributed to the preparation of srex 85 96 methodology reports edit within ipcc the national greenhouse gas inventory program develops methodologies to estimate emissions of greenhouse gases 97 this has been undertaken since 1991 by the ipcc wgi in close collaboration with the organisation for economic co-operation and development and the international energy agency the objectives of the national greenhouse gas inventory program are to develop and refine an internationally agreed methodology and software for the calculation and reporting of national greenhouse gas emissions and removals and to encourage the widespread use of this methodology by countries participating in the ipcc and by signatories of the unfccc revised 1996 ipcc guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories edit the 1996 guidelines for national greenhouse gas investories provide the methodological basis for the estimation of national greenhouse gas emissions inventories 98 over time these guidelines have been completed with good practice reports good practice guidance and uncertainty management in national greenhouse gas inventories and good practice guidance for land use land-use change and forestry the 1996 guidelines and the two good practice reports are to be used by parties to the unfccc and to the kyoto protocol in their annual submissions of national greenhouse gas inventories 2006 ipcc guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories edit the 2006 ipcc guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories is the latest version of these emission estimation methodologies including a large number of default emission factors clarification needed 99 although the ipcc prepared this new version of the guidelines on request of the parties to the unfccc the methods have not yet been officially accepted for use in national greenhouse gas emissions reporting under the unfccc and the kyoto protocol 100 activities edit the ipcc concentrates its activities on the tasks allotted to it by the relevant wmo executive council and unep governing council resolutions and decisions as well as on actions in support of the unfccc process 6 while the preparation of the assessment reports is a major ipcc function it also supports other activities such as the data distribution centre 101 and the national greenhouse gas inventories programme 102 required under the unfccc this involves publishing default emission factors which are factors used to derive emissions estimates based on the levels of fuel consumption industrial production and so on the ipcc also often answers inquiries from the unfccc subsidiary body for scientific and technological advice sbsta  nobel peace prize edit main article 2007 nobel peace prize wikisource has original text related to this article al gore s nobel peace prize acceptance speech in december 2007, the ipcc was awarded the nobel peace prize for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change  the award is shared with former u.s vice-president al gore for his work on climate change and the documentary an inconvenient truth 103 criticisms edit there is widespread support for the ipcc in the scientific community which is reflected in publications by other scientific bodies 41 62 72 and experts 104 however criticisms of the ipcc have been made 105 since 2010 the ipcc has come under yet unparalleled public and political scrutiny 106 the global ipcc consensus approach has been challenged internally 107 108 and externally with the 2009 climatic research unit email controversy climategate an important but not sole threshold 109 it has been deemed an information monopoly with results for both the quality and the impact of the ipcc work as such 107 110 projected date of melting of himalayan glaciers edit main article criticism of the ipcc ar4 a paragraph in the 2007 working group ii report impacts adaptation and vulnerability  chapter 10 included a projection that himalayan glaciers could disappear by 2035 glaciers in the himalaya are receding faster than in any other part of the world see table 10.9 and if the present rate continues the likelihood of them disappearing by the year 2035 and perhaps sooner is very high if the earth keeps warming at the current rate its total area will likely shrink from the present 500,000 to 100,000 km2 by the year 2035 wwf 2005  this projection was not included in the final summary for policymakers the ipcc has since acknowledged that the date is incorrect while reaffirming that the conclusion in the final summary was robust they expressed regret for the poor application of well-established ipcc procedures in this instance  the date of 2035 has been correctly quoted by the ipcc from the wwf report which has misquoted its own source an icsi report variations of snow and ice in the past and at present on a global and regional scale  rajendra k pachauri responded in an interview with science 111 overstatement of effects edit former ipcc chairman robert watson said regarding the himalayan glaciers estimation the mistakes all appear to have gone in the direction of making it seem like climate change is more serious by overstating the impact that is worrying the ipcc needs to look at this trend in the errors and ask why it happened  112 martin parry a climate expert 113 who had been co-chair of the ipcc working group ii said that what began with a single unfortunate error over himalayan glaciers has become a clamour without substance and the ipcc had investigated the other alleged mistakes which were generally unfounded and also marginal to the assessment  114 emphasis of the hockey stick graph edit main articles

temperature reconstruction based on a 1999 paper by michael e mann raymond s bradley and malcolm k hughes mbh99  which has been referred to as the hockey stick graph  this graph extended the similar graph in figure 3.20 from the ipcc second assessment report of 1995, and differed from a schematic in the first assessment report that lacked temperature units but appeared to depict larger global temperature variations over the past 1000 years and higher temperatures during the medieval warm period than the mid 20th century the schematic was not an actual plot of data and was based on a diagram of temperatures in central england with temperatures increased on the basis of documentary evidence of medieval vineyards in england even with this increase the maximum it showed for the medieval warm period did not reach temperatures recorded in central england in 2007. 115 the mbh99 finding was supported by cited reconstructions by jones et al 1998, pollack huang shen 1998, crowley lowery 2000 and briffa 2000, using differing data and methods the jones et al and briffa reconstructions were overlaid with the mbh99 reconstruction in figure 2.21 of the ipcc report 117 these studies were widely presented as demonstrating that the current warming period is exceptional in comparison to temperatures between 1000 and 1900, and the mbh99 based graph featured in publicity even at the draft stage this finding was disputed by contrarians in may 2000 fred singer s science and environmental policy project held a press event on capitol hill washington d.c. featuring comments on the graph wibjörn karlén and singer argued against the graph at a united states senate committee on commerce science and transportation hearing on 18 july 2000. contrarian john lawrence daly featured a modified version of the ipcc 1990 schematic which he mis-identified as appearing in the ipcc 1995 report and argued that overturning its own previous view in the 1995 report the ipcc presented the hockey stick as the new orthodoxy with hardly an apology or explanation for the abrupt u-turn since its 1995 report  118 criticism of the mbh99 reconstruction in a review paper which was quickly discredited in the soon and baliunas controversy was picked up by the bush administration and a senate speech by us republican senator james inhofe alleged that manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the american people  the data and methodology used to produce the hockey stick graph was criticized in papers by stephen mcintyre and ross mckitrick 119 and in turn the criticisms in these papers were examined by other studies and comprehensively refuted by wahl ammann 2007, 120 which showed errors in the methods used by mcintyre and mckitrick 121 on 23 june 2005, rep joe barton chairman of the house committee on energy and commerce wrote joint letters with ed whitfield chairman of the subcommittee on oversight and investigations demanding full records on climate research as well as personal information about their finances and careers from mann bradley and hughes 122 sherwood boehlert chairman of the house science committee said this was a misguided and illegitimate investigation apparently aimed at intimidating scientists and at his request the u.s national academy of sciences arranged for its national research council to set up a special investigation 123 the national research council s report agreed that there were some statistical failings but these had little effect on the graph which was generally correct in a 2006 letter to nature mann bradley and hughes pointed out that their original article had said that more widespread high-resolution data are needed before more confident conclusions can be reached and that the uncertainties were the point of the article  124 the ipcc fourth assessment report ar4 published in 2007 featured a graph showing 12 proxy based temperature reconstructions including the three highlighted in the 2001 third assessment report tar mann bradley hughes 1999 as before jones et al 1998 and briffa 2000 had both been calibrated by newer studies in addition analysis of the medieval warm period cited reconstructions by crowley lowery 2000 as cited in the tar and osborn briffa 2006. ten of these 14 reconstructions covered 1,000 years or longer most reconstructions shared some data series particularly tree ring data but newer reconstructions used additional data and covered a wider area using a variety of statistical methods the section discussed the divergence problem affecting certain tree ring data 125 conservative nature of ipcc reports edit some critics have contended that the ipcc reports tend to be conservative by consistently underestimating the pace and impacts of global warming 126 and report only the lowest common denominator findings 127 on 1 february 2007, the eve of the publication of ipcc s major report on climate a study was published suggesting that temperatures and sea levels have been rising at or above the maximum rates proposed during the last ipcc report in 2001. 128 the study compared ipcc 2001 projections on temperature and sea level change with observations over the six years studied the actual temperature rise was near the top end of the range given by ipcc s 2001 projection and the actual sea level rise was above the top of the range of the ipcc projection another example of scientific research which suggests that previous estimates by the ipcc far from overstating dangers and risks have actually understated them is a study on projected rises in sea levels when the researchers analysis was applied to the possible scenarios outlined by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc  the researchers found that in 2100 sea levels would be 0.5–1.4 m 50–140 cm above 1990 levels these values are much greater than the 9–88 cm as projected by the ipcc itself in its third assessment report published in 2001  this may have been due in part to the expanding human understanding of climate 129 130 greg holland from the national center for atmospheric research who reviewed a multi-meter sea level rise study by jim hansen noted “there is no doubt that the sea level rise within the ipcc is a very conservative number so the truth lies somewhere between ipcc and jim.” 131 in reporting criticism by some scientists that ipcc s then-impending january 2007 report understates certain risks particularly sea level rises an ap story quoted stefan rahmstorf professor of physics and oceanography at potsdam university as saying in a way it is one of the strengths of the ipcc to be very conservative and cautious and not overstate any climate change risk  132 in his december 2006 book hell and high water global warming and in an interview on fox news on 31 january 2007, energy expert joseph romm noted that the ipcc fourth assessment report is already out of date and omits recent observations and factors contributing to global warming such as the release of greenhouse gases from thawing tundra 133 political influence on the ipcc has been documented by the release of a memo by exxonmobil to the bush administration and its effects on the ipcc s leadership the memo led to strong bush administration lobbying evidently at the behest of exxonmobil to oust robert watson a climate scientist from the ipcc chairmanship and to have him replaced by pachauri who was seen at the time as more mild-mannered and industry-friendly 134 135 ipcc processes edit michael oppenheimer a long-time participant in the ipcc and coordinating lead author of the fifth assessment report conceded in science magazine s state of the planet 2008–2009 some limitations of the ipcc consensus approach and asks for concurring smaller assessments of special problems instead of the large scale approach as in the previous ipcc assessment reports 108 it has become more important to provide a broader exploration of uncertainties 108 others see as well mixed blessings of the drive for consensus within the ipcc process and ask to include dissenting or minority positions 136 or to improve statements about uncertainties 137 138 the ipcc process on climate change and its efficiency and success has been compared with dealings with other environmental challenges compare ozone depletion and global warming  in case of the ozone depletion global regulation based on the montreal protocol has been successful in case of climate change the kyoto protocol failed 139 the ozone case was used to assess the efficiency of the ipcc process 140 the lockstep situation of the ipcc is having built a broad science consensus while states and governments still follow different if not opposing goals 141 the underlying linear model of policy-making of more knowledge we have the better the political response will be is being doubted 141 142 according to sheldon ungar s comparison with global warming the actors in the ozone depletion case had a better understanding of scientific ignorance and uncertainties 143 the ozone case communicated to lay persons with easy-to-understand bridging metaphors derived from the popular culture and related to immediate risks with everyday relevance  while the public opinion on climate change sees no imminent danger 143 the stepwise mitigation of the ozone layer challenge was based as well on successfully reducing regional burden sharing conflicts 140 in case of the ipcc conclusions and the failure of the kyoto protocol varying regional cost-benefit analysis and burden-sharing conflicts with regard to the distribution of emission reductions remain an unsolved problem 139 in the uk a report for a house of lords committee asked to urge the ipcc to involve better assessments of costs and benefits of climate change 144 but the stern review ordered by the uk government made a stronger argument in favor to combat human-made climate change 145 outdatedness of reports edit since the ipcc does not carry out its own research it operates on the basis of scientific papers and independently documented results from other scientific bodies and its schedule for producing reports requires a deadline for submissions prior to the report s final release in principle this means that any significant new evidence or events that change our understanding of climate science between this deadline and publication of an ipcc report cannot be included in an area of science where our scientific understanding is rapidly changing this has been raised as a serious shortcoming in a body which is widely regarded as the ultimate authority on the science 146 however there has generally been a steady evolution of key findings and levels of scientific confidence from one assessment report to the next citation needed the submission deadlines for the fourth assessment report ar4 differed for the reports of each working group deadlines for the working group i report were adjusted during the drafting and review process in order to ensure that reviewers had access to unpublished material being cited by the authors the final deadline for cited publications was 24 july 2006. 147 the final wg i report was released on 30 april 2007 and the final ar4 synthesis report was released on 17 november 2007. rajendra pachauri the ipcc chair admitted at the launch of this report that since the ipcc began work on it scientists have recorded much stronger trends in climate change  like the unforeseen dramatic melting of polar ice in the summer of 2007, 148 and added that means you better start with intervention much earlier  149 burden on participating scientists edit scientists who participate in the ipcc assessment process do so without any compensation other than the normal salaries they receive from their home institutions the process is labor-intensive diverting time and resources from participating scientists research programs 150 concerns have been raised that the large uncompensated time commitment and disruption to their own research may discourage qualified scientists from participating 151 lack of error correction after publication edit in may 2010, pachauri noted that the ipcc currently had no process for responding to errors or flaws once it issued a report the problem according to pachauri was that once a report was issued the panels of scientists producing the reports were disbanded 152 proposed organizational overhaul edit in february 2010, in response to controversies regarding claims in the fourth assessment report 153 154 five climate scientists – all contributing or lead ipcc report authors – wrote in the journal nature calling for changes to the ipcc they suggested a range of new organizational options from tightening the selection of lead authors and contributors to dumping it in favor of a small permanent body or even turning the whole climate science assessment process into a moderated living wikipedia-ipcc 155 156 other recommendations included that the panel employ a full-time staff and remove government oversight from its processes to avoid political interference 157 interacademy council review edit in march 2010, at the invitation of the united nations secretary-general and the chair of the ipcc the interacademy council iac was asked to review the ipcc s processes for developing its reports 158 159 the iac panel chaired by harold tafler shapiro convened on 14 may 2010 and released its report on 1 september 2010. 152 160 the iac found that the ipcc assessment process has been successful overall  the panel however made seven formal recommendations for improving the ipcc s assessment process including establish an executive committee elect an executive director whose term would only last for one assessment encourage review editors to ensure that all reviewer comments are adequately considered and genuine controversies are adequately reflected in the assessment reports adopt a better process for responding to reviewer comments working groups should use a qualitative level-of-understanding scale in the summary for policy makers and technical summary quantitative probabilities as in the likelihood scale should be used to describe the probability of well-defined outcomes only when there is sufficient evidence and implement a communications plan that emphasizes transparency and establish guidelines for who can speak on behalf of the organization 161 the panel also advised that the ipcc avoid appearing to advocate specific policies in response to its scientific conclusions 162 commenting on the iac report nature news noted that the proposals were met with a largely favourable response from climate researchers who are eager to move on after the media scandals and credibility challenges that have rocked the united nations body during the past nine months  163 archiving edit papers and electronic files of certain working groups of the ipcc including reviews and comments on drafts of their assessment reports are archived at the environmental science and public policy archives in the harvard library endorsements of the ipcc edit various scientific bodies have issued official statements endorsing and concurring with the findings of the ipcc joint science academies statement of 2001. the work of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc represents the consensus of the international scientific community on climate change science we recognise ipcc as the world s most reliable source of information on climate change and its causes and we endorse its method of achieving this consensus  41 canadian foundation for climate and atmospheric sciences we concur with the climate science assessment of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc
