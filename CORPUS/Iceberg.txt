iceberg - wikipedia iceberg from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search for other uses see iceberg disambiguation  iceberg in the arctic with its underside visible an iceberg or ice mountain is a large piece of freshwater ice that has broken off a glacier or an ice shelf and is floating freely in open water 1 2 it may subsequently become frozen into pack ice one form of sea ice  as it drifts into shallower waters it may come into contact with the seabed a process referred to as seabed gouging by ice also about 91 of an iceberg is below the surface of the water etymology edit the word iceberg is a partial loan translation from the dutch word ijsberg literally meaning ice mountain 3 cognate to danish isbjerg german eisberg low saxon iesbarg and swedish isberg overview edit grotto in an iceberg photographed during the british antarctic expedition of 1911–1913 5 jan 1911. photographer herbert ponting alexander turnbull library because the density of pure ice is about 920 kg m3 and that of seawater about 1025 kg m3 typically one-tenth of the volume of an iceberg is above water due to archimedes s principle  the shape of the underwater portion can be difficult to judge by looking at the portion above the surface this has led to the expression tip of the iceberg  for a problem or difficulty that is only a small manifestation of a larger problem icebergs generally range from 1 to 75 metres 3.3 to 246.1 ft above sea level and weigh 100,000 to 200,000 metric tons 110,000 to 220,000 short tons  the largest known iceberg in the north atlantic was 168 metres 551 ft above sea level reported by the uscg icebreaker east wind in 1958, making it the height of a 55-story building these icebergs originate from the glaciers of western greenland and may have an interior temperature of −15 to −20 °c 5 to −4 °f  4 icebergs are usually confined by winds and currents to move close to the coast the largest icebergs recorded have been calved or broken off from the ross ice shelf of antarctica iceberg b-15 photographed by satellite in 2000, measured 295 by 37 kilometres 183 by 23 mi  with a surface area of 11,000 square kilometres 4,200 sq mi  the largest iceberg on record was an antarctic tabular iceberg of over 31,000 square kilometres 12,000 sq mi 335 by 97 kilometres 208 by 60 mi sighted 150 miles 240 km west of scott island in the south pacific ocean by the uss glacier on november 12, 1956. this iceberg was larger than belgium 5 when a piece of iceberg ice melts a fizzing sound called the bergie seltzer is produced this sound is made when the water-ice interface reaches compressed air bubbles trapped in the ice as this happens each bubble bursts making a popping sound the bubbles contain air trapped in snow layers very early in the history of the ice that eventually got buried to a given depth up to several kilometers and pressurized as it transformed into firn then to glacial ice 4 recent large icebergs edit the calving of iceberg a-38 off

broken off of petermann glacier in northern greenland on aug 5, 2010, considered to be the largest arctic iceberg since 1962. 9 about a month later this iceberg split into two pieces upon crashing into joe island in the nares strait next to greenland 10 in june 2011, large fragments of the petermann ice islands were observed off the labrador coast 11 iceberg b-17b 140 km2 54 sq mi  1999, shipping alert issued december 2009. 12 shape edit tabular iceberg near brown bluff in the antarctic sound off tabarin peninsula non-tabular iceberg off elephant island in the southern ocean in addition to size classification icebergs can be classified on the basis of their shape the two basic types of iceberg forms are tabular and non-tabular tabular icebergs have steep sides and a flat top much like a plateau with a length-to-height ratio of more than 5 1. 13 this type of iceberg also known as an ice island 14 can be quite large as in the case of pobeda ice island antarctic icebergs formed by breaking off from an ice shelf such as the ross ice shelf or filchner-ronne ice shelf are typically tabular the largest icebergs in the world are formed this way non-tabular icebergs have different shapes and include 15 different shapes of icebergs 1 tabular 2 wedge 3 dome 4 drydock 5 pinnacled 6 blocky dome an iceberg with a rounded top pinnacle an iceberg with one or more spires wedge an iceberg with a steep edge on one side and a slope on the opposite side dry-dock an iceberg that has eroded to form a slot or channel blocky an iceberg with steep vertical sides and a flat top it differs from tabular icebergs in that its shape is more like a block than a flat sheet monitoring edit acoustic monitoring of an iceberg icebergs are monitored worldwide by the u.s national ice center nic  established in 1995, which produces analyses and forecasts of arctic antarctic great lakes and chesapeake bay ice conditions more than 95 of the data used in its sea ice analyses are derived from the remote sensors on polar-orbiting satellites that survey these remote regions of the earth iceberg a22a in the south atlantic ocean the nic is the only organization that names and tracks all antarctic icebergs it assigns each iceberg larger than 10 nautical miles 19 km along at least one axis a name composed of a letter indicating its point of origin and a running number the letters used are as follows 16 a – longitude 0° to 90° w bellingshausen sea weddell sea b – longitude 90° w to 180° amundsen sea eastern ross sea c – longitude 90° e to 180° western ross sea wilkes land d – longitude 0° to 90° e amery ice shelf eastern weddell sea iceberg b15 calved from the ross ice shelf in 2000 and initially had an area of 11,000 square kilometres 4,200 sq mi  it broke apart in november 2002. the largest remaining piece of it iceberg b-15a with an area of 3,000 square kilometres 1,200 sq mi  was still the largest iceberg on earth until it ran aground and split into several pieces october 27, 2005, an event that was observed by seismographs both on the iceberg and across antarctica 17 it has been hypothesized that this breakup may also have been abetted by ocean swell generated by an alaskan storm 6 days earlier and 13,500 kilometres 8,400 mi away 18 19 history edit the iceberg suspected of sinking the rms titanic a smudge of red paint much like the titanic s red hull stripe was seen near its base at the waterline in the 20th century several scientific bodies were established to study and monitor the icebergs the international ice patrol formed in 1914 in response to the april 1912 sinking of the titanic which killed 1,517 of its 2,223 passengers and crew monitors iceberg dangers near the grand banks of newfoundland and provides the limits of all known ice in that vicinity to the maritime community technology history edit before the early 1910s there was no system in place to track icebergs to guard ships against collisions most likely because they weren t considered a serious threat as citation needed ships had managed to survive even direct crashes in 1907, ss kronprinz wilhelm a german liner had rammed an iceberg and suffered a crushed bow but was still able to complete her voyage the april 1912 sinking of the titanic however changed all that and created the demand for a system to observe icebergs for the remainder of the ice season of that year the united states navy patrolled the waters and monitored ice flow in november 1913, the international conference on the safety of life at sea met in london to devise a more permanent system of observing icebergs within three months the participating maritime nations had formed the international ice patrol iip  the goal of the iip was to collect data on meteorology and oceanography to measure currents ice-flow ocean temperature and salinity levels they published their first records in 1921, which allowed for a year-by-year comparison of iceberg movement new technologies monitor icebergs aerial surveillance of the seas in the early 1930s allowed for the development of charter systems that could accurately detail the ocean currents and iceberg locations in 1945, experiments tested the effectiveness of radar in detecting icebergs a decade later oceanographic monitoring outposts were established for the purpose of collecting data these outposts continue to serve in environmental study a computer was first installed on a ship for the purpose of oceanographic monitoring in 1964, which allowed for a faster evaluation of data by the 1970s icebreaking ships were equipped with automatic transmissions of satellite photographs of ice in antarctica systems for optical satellites had been developed but were still limited by weather conditions in the 1980s drifting buoys were used in antarctic waters for oceanographic and climate research they are equipped with sensors that measure ocean temperature and currents an iceberg being pushed by three u.s navy ships in mcmurdo sound antarctica side looking airborne radar slar made it possible to acquire images regardless of weather conditions on november 4, 1995, canada launched radarsat-1 developed by the canadian space agency it provides images of earth for scientific and commercial purposes this system was the first to use synthetic aperture radar sar  which sends microwave energy to the ocean surface and records the reflections to track icebergs the european space agency launched envisat an observation satellite that orbits the earth s poles 20 on march 1, 2002. envisat employs advanced synthetic aperture radar asar technology which can detect changes in surface height accurately the canadian space agency launched radarsat-2 in december 2007, which uses sar and multi-polarization modes and follows the same orbit path as radarsat-1 21
