live between bullz-eye.com and tyler labine the actor says invasion did get lots of love critics loved it there was quite a huge following by the time we got cancelled it was just the network didn’t love it that’s all he also acclaimed shaun cassidy s writing calling him a mad genius  8 later labine reiterates his statement about the show s cancellation i still to this day don’t know why that show got canceled we had great numbers we had a good show good critical acclaim… i don’t know but it was a really fun show 9 shaun cassidy said a similar statement about the show s cancellation i think there were unrealistic expectations that any show following lost should do better but no show after ours ever did do better so i suspect some of the execs may have regretted taking our show off the air 10 to the question of all the shows you’ve created that were canceled far too soon which hurt the most . and why  cassidy personally picked invasion because it was the most surprising
