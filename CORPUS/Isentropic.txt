isentropic process is an idealized thermodynamic process that is both adiabatic and reversible 1 2 3 4 5 6 the work transfers of the system are frictionless and there is no transfer of heat or matter such an idealized process is useful in engineering as a model of and basis of comparison for real processes 7 the word isentropic is occasionally though not customarily interpreted in another way reading it as if its meaning were deducible from its etymology this is contrary to its original and customarily used definition in this occasional reading it means a process in which the entropy of the system remains unchanged for example because work done on the system includes friction internal to the system and heat is withdrawn from the system in just the right amount to compensate for the internal friction so as to leave the entropy unchanged 8 background edit the second law of thermodynamics states that t d s ≥ δ q \displaystyle tds\geq \delta q where δ q \displaystyle \delta q is the amount of energy the system gains by heating t \displaystyle t is the temperature of the system and d s \displaystyle ds is the change in entropy the equal sign refers to a reversible process which is an imagined idealized theoretical limit never actually occurring in physical reality 9 10 for an isentropic process which by definition is reversible there is no transfer of energy as heat because the process is adiabatic in an irreversible process of transfer of energy as work entropy is produced within the system consequently in order to maintain constant entropy within the system energy must be removed from the system as heat during the process for reversible processes an isentropic transformation is carried out by thermally insulating the system from its surroundings temperature is the thermodynamic conjugate variable to entropy thus the conjugate process would be an isothermal process in which the system is thermally connected to a constant-temperature heat bath isentropic processes in thermodynamic systems edit t-s entropy vs temperature diagram of an isentropic process which is a vertical line segment the entropy of a given mass does not change during a process that is internally reversible and adiabatic a process during which the entropy remains constant is called an isentropic process written δ s 0 \displaystyle \delta s 0 or s 1 s 2 \displaystyle s 1 s 2  11 some examples of theoretically isentropic thermodynamic devices are pumps gas compressors turbines nozzles and diffusers isentropic efficiencies of steady-flow devices in thermodynamic systems edit most steady-flow devices operate under adiabatic conditions and the ideal process for these devices is the isentropic process.the parameter that describes how efficiently a device approximates a corresponding isentropic device is called isentropic or adiabatic efficiency 12 isentropic efficiency of turbines η t actual turbine work isentropic turbine work w a w s ≅ h 1 − h 2 a h 1 − h 2 s

compression in a compressor note the isentropic assumptions are only applicable with ideal cycles real cycles have inherent losses due to compressor and turbine inefficiencies and the second law of thermodynamics real systems are not truly isentropic but isentropic behavior is an adequate approximation for many calculation purposes isentropic flow edit in fluid dynamics an isentropic flow is a fluid flow that is both adiabatic and reversible that is no heat is added to the flow and no energy transformations occur due to friction or dissipative effects for an isentropic flow of a perfect gas several relations can be derived to define the pressure density and temperature along a streamline note that energy can be exchanged with the flow in an isentropic transformation as long as it doesn t happen as heat exchange an example of such an exchange would be an isentropic expansion or compression that entails work done on or by the flow for an isentropic flow entropy density can vary between different streamlines if the entropy density is the same everywhere then the flow is said to be homentropic derivation of the isentropic relations edit for a closed system the total change in energy of a system is the sum of the work done and the heat added d u δ w δ q \displaystyle du \delta w \delta q\,\ the reversible work done on a system by changing the volume is d w − p d v \displaystyle dw -pdv\,\ where p \displaystyle p is the pressure and v \displaystyle v is the volume the change in enthalpy h u p v \displaystyle h u pv\,\ is given by d h d u p d v v d p \displaystyle dh du pdv vdp\,\ then for a process that is both reversible and adiabatic i.e no heat transfer occurs  δ q r e v 0 \displaystyle \delta q rev 0\,\  and so d s δ q r e v t 0 \displaystyle ds \delta q rev t 0\,\  all reversible adiabatic processes are isentropic this leads to two important observations d u δ w δ q − p d v 0 \displaystyle du \delta w \delta q -pdv 0\,\  and d h δ w δ q p d v v d p − p d v 0 p d v v d p v d p \displaystyle dh \delta w \delta q pdv vdp -pdv 0 pdv vdp vdp\,\ next a great deal can be computed for isentropic processes of an ideal gas for any transformation of an ideal gas it is always true that d u n c v d t \displaystyle du nc v dt\,\  and d h n c p d t \displaystyle dh nc p dt\,\  using the general results derived above for d u \displaystyle du and d h \displaystyle dh  then d u n c v d t − p d v \displaystyle du nc v dt -pdv\,\  and d h n c p d t v d p \displaystyle dh nc p dt vdp\,\  so for an ideal gas the heat capacity ratio can be written as γ c p c v − d p p d
