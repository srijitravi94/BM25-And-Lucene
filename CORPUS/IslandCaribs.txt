are an indigenous people of the lesser antilles in the caribbean they may have descended from the mainland caribs kalina of south america but they spoke an unrelated language known as island carib at the time of spanish contact the caribs were one of the dominant groups in the caribbean which owes its name to them they lived throughout the windward islands dominica and possibly the southern leeward islands historically it was thought their ancestors were mainland caribs known as the igneri the igneri had conquered the islands from their previous inhabitants however linguistic and archaeological evidence disputes the notion of a mass emigration and conquest the island carib language appears not to have been cariban but arawakan like that of their neighbors the taíno irving rouse and others suggest that a smaller group of mainland caribs conquered the islands without displacing their inhabitants eventually adopting the local language but retaining their traditions of a south american origin 3 in the early colonial period the caribs had a reputation as warriors who raided neighboring islands it was claimed that they practiced cannibalism – the word cannibal derives from a corruption of their name 4 according to the spanish conquistadores the carib indians were cannibals who regularly ate roasted human flesh archaeological evidence indicates that they limited the consumption of humans to ceremonial occasions there is evidence as to the taking of human trophies and the ritual cannibalism of war captives among both carib and other amerindian groups such as the arawak and tupinamba today the caribs and their descendants continue to live in the antilles the garifuna or black caribs a group of mixed carib and african ancestry also live principally in central

assimilation the taíno had settled the island chains earlier in history migrating from the mainland 5 greenstone ceremonial axe from shell midden mt irvine bay tobago 1957. caribs traded with the eastern taíno of the caribbean islands the caribs produced the silver products which ponce de leon found in taíno communities none of the insular amerindians mined for gold but obtained it by trade from the mainland the caribs were skilled boat builders and sailors they appeared to have owed their dominance in the caribbean basin to their mastery of warfare according to floyd the question arose in columbus s time whether indians could be enslaved and queen isabel had ruled against it at about the same time however ojeda bastidas and other explorers voyaging along the spanish main had been attacked by indians with poisoned arrows - all such indians were considered caribs - which took a considerable toll of spanish lives these attacks and the evidence some of the perpetrators at least were cannibals provided the rationale for the decree authorizing enslavement of caribs on 3 june 1511, king ferdinand declared war on the caribs 6 island caribs nevertheless mostly succeeded in keeping their islands unoccupied by spaniards in the 17th century island caribs were displaced with a great loss of life by a new wave of european invaders french and english most fatalities resulted from eurasian infectious diseases such as smallpox which they had no natural immunity to as well as warfare in 1660, france and england signed with island caribs the treaty of saint charles that stipulated that caribs would evacuate all the lesser antilles except for dominica and saint vincent which were recognized as reserves however the english would later ignore the treaty and ended up annexing both islands in 1763. 7 to this date a small population of around 3,000 caribs survives in the carib territory in northeast dominica the black caribs later known as carifuna of st vincent st vincent has some yellow caribs as well were descended from a group of enslaved africans who were marooned from shipwrecks of slave ships as well as slaves who escaped here chief kairouane and his men from grenada jumped off of the “leapers hill rather than face slavery under the french invaders and have served as an iconic representation of the caribs spirit of resistance 8 9 10 they intermarried with the carib and formed the last native culture to resist the british it was not until 1795 that british colonists deported the black caribs to roatan island off honduras their descendants continue to live there today and are known as the garifuna ethnic group carib resistance delayed the settlement of dominica by europeans the black carib communities that remained in st vincent and dominica retained a degree of autonomy well into the 19th century the last known speakers of island carib died in the 1930s and the language is extinct people edit the kalinago of dominica maintained their independence for many years by taking advantage of the island s rugged terrain the island s east coast includes a 3,700-acre 15 km2 territory formerly known as the carib territory that was granted to the people by the british crown in 1903. there are only 3,000 caribs remaining they elect their own chief in july 2003, the kalinago observed 100 years of territory in july 2014, charles williams was

make fantastical decorations of many colours the eyes of the females were usually circled with black the men also painted their bodies and on occasion wore feathered headdresses jewellery through their lips and jewellery through their noses they wore the caracoli which was a necklace of small bones along with the teeth of defeated enemies from which a crescent shaped ornament was suspended the caracoli was worn to represent the courage of the wearer religion edit the caribs are believed to have been polytheists as the spanish began to colonise the caribbean area they wanted to convert the natives to catholicism 12 the religion practised by the caribs had elements similar to the ancestor worship of the taíno they believed in an evil spirit called maybouya who had to be placated for an individual to avoid harm the chief function of their shamans called buyeis was to heal the sick with herbs and to cast spells piai which would keep maybouya at bay the buyeis were very important and underwent special training instead of becoming warriors as they were held to be the only people who could avert evil they were treated with great respect their ceremonies were accompanied with sacrifices as with the arawaks and other native americans the caribs smoked tobacco in the rituals of their religion social organization edit early carib culture was patriarchal women carried out the domestic duties of rearing young children processing and producing food and clothing and cultivating the land for farming including sowing and harvesting men carried out the tasks of hunting for food

or women typically run by one or more chieftains reporting to an island council food edit the caribs ate almost the same foods as the tainos they did not farm very well so they relied less on maize and cassava but still knew how to grow them although they were not very good farmers the caribs were excellent fishermen and were not afraid of long voyages their diet consisted of lots of protein they ate manatees ducks iguanas and fish among other foods the caribs had many myths and beliefs about diet - they believed that eating pig would give one small beady eyes they also believed eating turtle meat made one stupid 14 in doing so they deprived themselves of the protein that was easily available in the west indies they also believed that eating crab before a voyage would bring storms the caribs seasoned their food with pepper but did not use salt couii and taumalin were pepper sauces taumalin was made from pepper lemon juice and the green meat of crab the caribs made ouicou  a cassava beer with a strong alcoholic content and got very drunk on festivals and holidays although their diet was not quite so varied as that of the arawaks it was well balanced prepared in many different ways and served with different seasonings 14 music edit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may
