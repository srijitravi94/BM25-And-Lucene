research and development agency on aerospace research and development is japan s national aero-space agency through the merger of three previously independent organizations jaxa was formed on 1 october 2003. jaxa is responsible for research technology development and the launch of satellites into orbit and is involved in many more advanced missions such as asteroid exploration and possible manned exploration of the moon 2 its motto is one jaxa 3 and its corporate slogan is explore to realize formerly reaching for the skies exploring space  4 history edit see also japan s space development jaxa kibo the largest module of the iss on 1 october 2003, three organizations were merged to form the new jaxa japan s institute of space and astronautical science or isas  the national aerospace laboratory of japan nal  and national space development agency of japan nasda  jaxa was formed as an independent administrative institution administered by the ministry of education culture sports science and technology mext and the ministry of internal affairs and communications mic  5 before the merger isas was responsible for space and planetary research while nal was focused on aviation research nasda which was founded on 1 october 1969, had developed rockets satellites and also built the japanese experiment module the old nasda headquarters were located at the current site of the tanegashima space center on tanegashima island 115 kilometers south of kyūshū nasda also trained japanese astronauts who flew with the us space shuttles 6 in 2012, new legislation extended jaxa s remit from peaceful purposes only to include some military space development such as missile early warning systems political control of jaxa passed from mext to the prime minister s cabinet office through a new space strategy office 7 organization edit head office tanegashima space center jaxa is composed of the following organizations space transportation mission directorate satellite applications mission directorate i satellite applications mission directorate ii human spaceflight mission directorate aerospace research and development directorate institute of space and astronautical science isas institute of aeronautical technology jaxa has research centers in many locations in japan and some offices overseas its headquarters are in chōfu tokyo it also has earth observation research center eorc  tokyo earth observation center eoc in hatoyama saitama noshiro testing center ntc in noshiro akita – established in 1962. it carries out development and testing of rocket engines sanriku balloon center sbc – balloons have been launched from this site since 1971. kakuda space center kspc in kakuda miyagi – leads the development of rocket engines works mainly with development of liquid fuel engines sagamihara campus isas – development of experimental equipment for rockets and satellites also administrative buildings tanegashima space center - currently the launch site for the h-iia and h-iib rockets tsukuba space center tksc in tsukuba this is the center of japan s space network it is involved in research and development of satellites and rockets and tracking and controlling of satellites it develops experimental equipment for the japanese experiment module kibo  training of astronauts also takes place here for international space station operations the japanese flight control team is located at the space station integration promotion center ssipc in tsukuba ssipc communicates regularly with iss crewmembers via s-band audio 8 uchinoura space center - currently the launch site for the epsilon rocket rockets edit jaxa uses the h-iia h two a rocket from the former nasda body and its variant h-iib to launch engineering test satellites weather satellites etc for science missions like x-ray astronomy jaxa uses the epsilon rocket for experiments in the upper atmosphere jaxa uses the ss-520 s-520 and s-310 sounding rockets successes edit prior to the establishment of jaxa isas had been most successful in its space program in the field of x-ray astronomy during the 1980s and 1990s another successful area for japan has been very long baseline interferometry vlbi with the halca mission additional success was achieved with solar observation and research of the magnetosphere among other areas nasda was mostly active in the field of communication satellite technology however since the satellite market of japan is completely open the first time a japanese company won a contract for a civilian communication satellite was in 2005. another prime focus of the nasda body is earth climate observation jaxa was awarded the space foundation s john l jack swigert jr. award for space exploration in 2008. 9 launch development and missions edit h-iia h-iib rocket history edit japan launched its first satellite ōsumi in 1970, using isas l-4s rocket prior to the merger isas used small solid-fueled launch vehicles while nasda developed larger liquid-fueled launchers in the beginning nasda used licensed american models the first model of liquid-fuelled launch vehicle indigenously developed in japan was the h-ii introduced in 1994. however at the end of the 1990s with two h-ii launch failures japanese rocket technology began to face criticism 10 early h-iia missions edit japan s first space mission under jaxa an h-iia rocket launch on 29 november 2003, ended in failure due to stress problems after a 15-month hiatus jaxa performed a successful launch of an h-iia rocket from tanegashima space center placing a satellite into orbit on 26 february 2005. orbital ss-520 mission edit in january 2017, jaxa attempted and failed to put a mini satellite into orbit atop one of its ss520 series rockets had the launch succeeded it would have been the smallest to ever place an object in orbit 11 lunar and interplanetary missions edit japan s first missions beyond earth orbit were the 1985 halley s comet observation satellites sakigake ms-t5 and suisei planet-a  to prepare for future missions isas tested earth swing by orbits with the hiten mission in 1990. the first japanese interplanetary mission was the mars orbiter nozomi planet-b  which was launched in 1998. it reached its target in 2003, but orbit injection had to be given up currently interplanetary missions remain at the isas group under the jaxa umbrella however for fy 2008 jaxa is planning to set up an independent working group within the organization new head for this group will be hayabusa project manager kawaguchi 12 active missions planet-c ikaros hayabusa 2 under development slim retired planet-b selene muses-c cancelled lunar-a small body exploration hayabusa mission edit hayabusa on 9 may 2003, hayabusa meaning peregrine falcon  was launched from an m-v rocket the goal of the mission was to collect samples from a small near-earth asteroid named 25143 itokawa the craft rendezvoused with the asteroid in september 2005. it was confirmed that the spacecraft successfully landed on the asteroid in november 2005, after some initial confusion regarding the incoming data hayabusa returned to earth with samples from the asteroid on 13 june 2010. see also hayabusa 2 lunar explorations edit after hiten in 1990, isas planned a lunar penetrator mission called lunar-a but after delays due to technical problems the project was terminated in january 2007. the seismometer penetrator design for lunar-a may be reused in a future mission on 14 september 2007, jaxa succeeded in launching the lunar orbit explorer kaguya also known as selene costing 55 billion yen including launch vehicle  the largest such mission since the apollo program on an h-2a rocket its mission is to gather data on the moon s origin and evolution it entered lunar orbit on 4 october 2007. 13 14 after 1 year and 8 months it impacted the lunar surface on 10 june 2009 at 18 25 utc jaxa plans to launch its first lunar surface mission slim smart lander for investigating moon on an epsilon rocket in fiscal year 2019. 15 planetary exploration edit japan s planetary missions have so far been limited to the inner solar system and emphasis has been put on magnetospheric and atmospheric research the mars explorer nozomi planet-b  which isas launched prior to the merger of the three aerospace institutes became one of the earliest difficulties the newly formed jaxa faced nozomi ultimately passed 1,000 km from the surface of mars on 20 may 2010, the venus climate orbiter akatsuki planet-c and ikaros solar sail demonstrator was launched by a h-2a launch vehicle on 7 december 2010, akatsuki was unable to complete its venus orbit insertion maneuver akatsuki finally entered venus orbit in 7 december 2015, making it the first japanese spacecraft to orbit another planet sixteen years after the originally planned orbital insertion of nozomi one of akatsuki s main goal is to uncover the mechanism behind venus atmosphere s super-rotation a phenomenon in which the cloud top winds in the toposphere circulates around the planet faster than the speed that venus itself rotates a thorough explanation for this phenomenon has yet been found jaxa isas was part of the international laplace jupiter mission proposal from its foundation a japanese contribution was sought in the form of an independent orbiter to research jupiter s magnetosphere jmo jupiter magnetospheric orbiter  although jmo never left the conception phase isas scientists will see their instruments reaching jupiter on the esa-led juice jupiter icy moon explorer mission juice is a reformulation of the esa ganymede orbiter from the laplace project jaxa s contribution includes providing components of the rpwi radio plasma wave investigation  pep particle environment package  gala ganymede laser altimeter instruments jaxa is reviewing a new spacecraft mission to the martian system a sample return mission to phobos called mmx martian moons explorer  16 17 first revealed in 9 june 2015, mmx s primary goal is to determine the origin of the martian moons 18 alongside collecting samples from phobos mmx will perform remote sensing of deimos and may also observe the atmosphere of mars as well 19 as of january 2016, mmx is to be launched in fiscal year 2022. 20 see also bepicolombo solar sail research edit on 9 august 2004, isas successfully deployed two prototype solar sails from a sounding rocket a clover type sail was deployed at 122 km altitude and a fan type sail was deployed at 169 km altitude both sails used 7.5 micrometer thick film isas tested a solar sail again as a sub payload to the akari astro-f mission on 22 february 2006. however the solar sail did not deploy fully isas tested a solar sail again as a sub payload of the solar-b launch at 23 september 2006, but contact with the probe was lost the ikaros solar sail was launched on 21 may 2010. the solar sail deployed successfully the goal is to have a solar sail mission to jupiter after 2020. astronomy program edit see also scientific research on the iss the first japanese astronomy mission was x-ray satellite hakucho corsa-b  which was launched in 1979. later isas moved into solar observation radio astronomy through space vlbi and infrared astronomy active missions solar-b maxi sprint-a calet under development xarm retired astro-f astro-eii astro-h cancelled astro-g infrared astronomy edit astro-e japan s first infrared astronomy mission was the 15 cm irts telescope which was part of the sfu multipurpose satellite in 1995. irts scanned during its one-month lifetime around 7 of the sky before sfu got brought back to earth by the space shuttle during the 1990s jaxa also gave ground support for the esa infrared space observatory iso infrared mission the next step for jaxa was the akari spacecraft with the pre-launch designation astro-f this satellite was launched on 21 february 2006. its mission is infrared astronomy with a 68 cm telescope this is the first all sky survey since the first infrared mission iras in 1983. a 3.6 kg nanosatellite named cute-1.7 was also released from the same launch vehicle 21 jaxa is also doing further r d for increasing the performance of its mechanical coolers for its future infrared mission spica this would enable a warm launch without liquid helium spica has the same size as the esa herschel space observatory mission but is planned to have a temperature of just 4.5 k and will be much colder unlike akari which had a geocentric orbit spica will be located at sun–earth l2 the launch is expected in 2027 or 2028 on jaxa s new h3 launch vehicle however the mission is not yet fully funded esa and nasa may also each contribute an instrument 22 x-ray astronomy edit starting from 1979 with hakucho corsa-b  for nearly two decades japan had achieved continuous observation with its hinotori tenma ginga and asca astro-a through d x-ray observation satellites however in the year 2000 the launch of japan s fifth x-ray observation satellite astro-e failed as it failed at launch it never received a proper name  then on 10 july 2005, jaxa was finally able to launch a new x-ray astronomy mission named suzaku astro-eii  this launch was important for jaxa because in the five years since the launch failure of the original astro-e satellite japan was without an x-ray telescope three instruments were included in this satellite an x-ray spectrometer xrs  an x-ray imaging spectrometer xis  and a hard x-ray detector hxd  however the xrs was rendered inoperable due to a malfunction which caused the satellite to lose its supply of liquid helium the next jaxa x-ray mission is the monitor of all-sky x-ray image maxi  maxi continuously monitors astronomical x-ray objects over a broad energy band 0.5 to 30 kev  maxi is installed on the japanese external module of the iss 23 on 17 february 2016, hitomi astro-h was launched as the successor to suzaku which completed its mission a year before see also astro-h solar observation edit japan s solar astronomy started in the early 80s with the launch of the hinotori astro-a x-ray mission the hinode solar-b spacecraft the follow-on to the joint japan us uk yohkoh solar-a spacecraft was launched on 23 september 2006. 24 25 a solar-c can be expected sometime after 2020. however no details are worked out yet other than it will not be launched with the former isas s mu rockets instead a h-2a from tanegashima could launch it as h-2a is more powerful solar-c could either be heavier or be stationed at l1 lagrange point 1  radio astronomy edit in 1998 japan launched the halca muses-b mission the world s first spacecraft dedicated to conduct space vlbi observations of pulsars among others to do so isas set up a ground network around the world through international cooperation the observation part of the mission lasted until 2003 and the satellite was retired at the end of 2005. in fy 2006 japan funded the astro-g as the succeeding mission for details see halca astro-g communication positioning and technology tests edit one of the primary duties of the former nasda body was the testing of new space technologies mostly in the field of communication the first test satellite was ets-i launched in 1975. however during the 1990s nasda was hit by bad luck with the problems surrounding the ets-vi and comets missions testing of communication technologies remains to be one of jaxa s key duties in cooperation with nict active missions index winds qzs-1 under development slats qzs-2 qzs-3 qzs-4 ets-ix retired oicets ets-viii i-space ets-viii winds and qzs-1 edit to upgrade japan s communication technology the japanese state launched the i-space initiative with the ets-viii and winds missions 26 ets-viii was launched on 18 december 2006. the purpose of ets-viii is to test communication equipment with two very large antennas and an atomic clock test on 26 december both antennas were successfully deployed this didn t come unexpected since jaxa tested the deployment mechanism before with the ldrex-2 mission which was launched on 14 october with the european ariane 5. the test was successful the mission of winds kizuna is to create the worlds fastest satellite internet connection winds was launched in february 2008. oicets and index edit on 24 august 2005, jaxa launched the experimental satellites oicets and index on a ukrainian dnepr rocket oicets kirari is a mission tasked with tesing optical links with the european space agency esa artemis satellite which is around 40,000 km away from oicets the experiment was successful on 9 december when the link could be established in march 2006 jaxa could establish with oicets the worldwide first optical links between a leo satellite and a ground station first in japan and in june 2006 with a mobile station in germany index reimei is a small 70 kg satellite for testing various equipment and functions as an aurora observation mission as well the reimei satellite is currently in its extended mission phase earth observation programme edit japan s first earth observation satellites were mos-1a and mos-1b launched in 1987 and 1990. during the 1990s and the new millennium this programme came under heavy fire because both adeos midori and adeos 2 midori 2 satellites failed after just 10 months in orbit active missions gosat gcom-w alos-2 under development gcom-c gosat-2 alos-3 retired alos alos edit mtsat-1 in january 2006, jaxa successfully launched the advanced land observation satellite alos daichi  communication between alos and the ground station in japan will be done through the kodama data relay satellite which was launched during 2002. this project is under intense pressure due to the shorter than expected lifetime of the adeos ii midori earth observation mission for missions following daichi jaxa opted to separate it into a radar satellite alos-2 and an optical satellite alos-3  alos 2 sar was launched in may 2014. rainfall observation edit since japan is an island nation and gets struck by typhoons every year research about the dynamics of the atmosphere is a very important issue for this reason japan launched in 1997 the trmm tropical rainfall measuring mission satellite in cooperation with nasa to observe the tropical rainfall seasons for further research nasda had launched the adeos and adeos ii missions in 1996 and 2003. however due to various reasons both satellites had a much shorter than expected life term on 28 february 2014, a h-2a rocket launched the gpm core observatory a satellite jointly developed by jaxa and nasa the gpm mission is the successor to the trmm mission which by the time of the gpm launch had been noted as highly successful jaxa provided the global precipitation measurement dual-frequency precipitation radar gpm dpr instrument for this mission global precipitation measurement itself is a satellite constellation whilst the gpm core observatory provides a new calibration standard for other satellites in the constellation other countries agencies like france india esa etc provides the subsatellites the aim of gpm is to measure global rainfall with unprecedented detail monitoring of carbon dioxide edit at the end of the 2008 fiscal year jaxa launched the satellite gosat greenhouse gas observing satellite to help scientists determine and monitor the density distribution of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere the satellite is being jointly developed by jaxa and japan s ministry of the environment jaxa is building the satellite while the ministry is in charge of the data that will be collected since the number of ground-based carbon dioxide observatories cannot monitor enough of the world s atmosphere and are distributed unevenly throughout the globe the gosat may be able to gather more accurate data and fill in the gaps on the globe where there are no observatories on the ground sensors for methane and other greenhouse gasses are also being considered for the satellite although the plans are not yet finalized the satellite weighs approximately 1650 kg and is expected to have a life span of 5 years gcom series edit next funded earth observation mission after gosat is the gcom global change observation mission earth observation programme as a successor to adeos ii midori and the aqua mission to reduce the risk and for a longer observation time the mission will be split into smaller satellites altogether gcom will be a series of six satellites the first satellite gcom-w shizuku was launched on 17 may 2012 with the h-iia the launch of the second satellite gcom-c is currently planned for 2017. satellites for other agencies edit for weather observation japan launched in february 2005 the multi-functional transport satellite 1r mtsat-1r  the success of this launch was critical for japan since the original mtsat-1 couldn t be put into orbit because of a launch failure with the h-2 rocket in 1999. since then japan relied for weather forecasting on an old satellite which was already beyond its useful life term and on american systems on 18 february 2006, jaxa as head of the h-iia at this time successfully launched the mtsat-2 aboard a h-2a rocket mtsat-2 is the backup to the mtsat-1r the mtsat-2 uses the ds-2000 satellite bus developed by mitsubishi electric 27 the ds-2000 is also used for the drts kodama ets-viii and the superbird 7 communication satellite making it the first commercial success for japan as a secondary mission both the mtsat-1r and mtsat-2 help to direct air traffic other jaxa satellites currently in use edit geotail magnetosphere observation satellite since 1992 drts kodama data relay satellite since 2002. projected life span is 7 years ongoing joint

jaxa launched the wideband internetworking engineering test and demonstration satellite winds  also called kizuna winds will facilitate experiments with faster internet connections the launch using h-iia launch vehicle 14, took place from the tanegashima space center 28 on 10 september 2009 the first h-iib rocket was successfully launched delivering the htv-1 freighter to resupply the international space station 29 in the year 2009 jaxa plans to launch the first satellite of the quasi zenith satellite system qzss  a subsystem of the global positioning system gps  two others are expected to follow later if successful one satellite will be in a zenith position over japan full-time the qzss mission is the last scheduled major independent mission for jaxa as no major civilian projects were funded after that for now the only exception is the igs programme which will be continued beyond 2008. however it seems japan is pressing forward now with the gcom earth observation satellites as successors to the adeos missions first launch is planned for 2010. in 2009 japan also plans to launch a new version of the igs with an improved resolution of 60 cm launch schedule edit

ten astronauts but has not yet developed its own manned spacecraft and is not currently developing one officially a potentially manned space shuttle-spaceplane hope-x project launched by the conventional space launcher h-ii was developed for several years including test flights of hyflex orex prototypes but was postponed the simpler manned capsule fuji was proposed but not adopted projects for single-stage to orbit horizontal takeoff reusable launch vehicle and landing assts and the vertical takeoff and landing kankoh-maru also exist but have not been adopted the first japanese citizen to fly in space was toyohiro akiyama a journalist sponsored by tbs who flew on the soviet soyuz tm-11 in december 1990. he spent more than seven days in space on the mir space station in what the soviets called their first commercial spaceflight which allowed them to earn 14 million japan participates in us and international manned space programs including flights of japanese astronauts on russian soyuz spacecraft to the iss one space shuttle mission sts-47 in september 1992 was partially funded by japan this flight included jaxa s first astronaut in space mamoru mohri as the payload

budget constraints 33 in june 2014 japan s science and technology ministry said it was considering a space mission to mars in a ministry paper it indicated unmanned exploration manned missions to mars and long-term settlement on the moon were objectives for which international cooperation and support was going to be sought 34 on october 18th 2017, japanese discovery of a tunnel under the surface of the moon has led to press-release 35  the tunnel seems to be suitable as a location for a base-of-operations of peaceful manned space missions according to jaxa supersonic aircraft development edit besides the h-iia b and epsilon rockets jaxa is also developing technology for a next-generation supersonic transport that could become the commercial replacement for the concorde the design goal of the project working name next generation supersonic transport is to develop a jet that can carry 300 passengers at mach 2. a subscale model of the jet underwent aerodynamic testing in september and october 2005 in australia 36 in 2015 jaxa performed tests aimed at reducing the effects of super sonic flight under the d-send program 37 the economic success of such a project is still unclear and as a consequence the project has been met with limited interest from japanese aerospace companies like mitsubishi heavy industries so far reusable launch vehicles edit until 2003 citation needed jaxa
