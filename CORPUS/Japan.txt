which is pronounced nihon or nippon and literally means the origin of the sun  the character nichi 日 means sun or day hon 本 means base or origin  24 the compound therefore means origin of the sun and is the source of the popular western epithet land of the rising sun  25 the earliest record of the name nihon appears in the chinese historical records of the tang dynasty the old book of tang at the end of the seventh century a delegation from japan requested that nihon be used as the name of their country this name may have its origin in a letter sent in 607 and recorded in the official history of the sui dynasty prince shōtoku the regent of japan sent a mission to china with a letter in which he called himself the emperor of the land where the sun rises 日出處天子  the message said here i the

homophone of wo 倭 pronounced wa by the japanese  which has been used by the chinese as a designation for the japanese as early as the third century three kingdoms period 26 however the japanese disliked some connotation of wa 倭 which has been associated in china with concepts like dwarf or pygmy  and it was therefore replaced with the substitute character wa 和  meaning togetherness harmony
