three kingdoms of korea which were unified as unified silla to the south and balhae to the north unified silla divided into three separate states during the later three kingdoms period goryeo which had succeeded goguryeo defeated the two other states and united the korean peninsula around the same time balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to goryeo goryeo also spelled as koryŏ  whose name developed into the modern exonym korea  was a highly cultured state that created the world s first metal movable type in 1234. 4 5 6 7 8 9 however multiple invasions by the mongol yuan dynasty during the 13th century greatly weakened the nation which eventually agreed to become a vassal state after decades of fighting following the yuan dynasty s collapse severe political strife followed and goryeo eventually fell to a coup led by general yi seong-gye who established joseon in 1392. the first 200 years of joseon were marked by relative peace during this period the korean alphabet was created by sejong the great in the 15th century and there was increasing influence of confucianism during the later part of the dynasty korea s isolationist policy earned it the western nickname of the hermit kingdom  by the late 19th century the country became the object of imperial design by the empire of japan after the first sino-japanese war despite the korean empire s effort to modernize it was annexed by japan in 1910 and ruled by imperial japan until the end of world war ii in august 1945. in 1945, the soviet union and the united states agreed on the surrender of japanese forces in korea in the aftermath of world war ii leaving korea partitioned along the 38th parallel the north was under soviet occupation and the south under u.s occupation these circumstances soon became the basis for the division of korea by the two superpowers exacerbated by their incapability to agree on the terms of korean independence the communist-inspired government in the north received backing from the soviet union in opposition to the pro-western government in the south leading to korea s division into two political entities north korea formally the democratic people s republic of korea  and south korea formally the republic of korea  tensions between the two resulted in the outbreak of the korean war in 1950. with involvement by foreign troops the war ended in a stalemate in 1953, but without a formalized peace treaty this status contributes to the high tensions that continue to divide the peninsula to date each country contends that it is the sole legitimate government

powers in east asia 20 21 22 23 reaching its zenith in the 5th century when its territories expanded to encompass most of manchuria to the north parts of inner mongolia to the west 24 parts of russia to the east 25 and the seoul region to the south 26 goguryeo experienced a golden age under gwanggaeto the great and his son jangsu 27 28 29 30 who both subdued baekje and silla during their times achieving a brief unification of the three kingdoms of korea and becoming the most dominant power on the korean peninsula 31 32 in addition to contesting for control of the korean peninsula goguryeo had many military conflicts with various chinese dynasties 33 most notably the goguryeo-sui war in which goguryeo defeated a huge force said to number over a million men 34 35 36 37 38 in 642, the powerful general yeon gaesomun led a coup and gained complete control over goguryeo in response emperor tang taizong of china led a campaign against goguryeo but was defeated and retreated 39 40 after

662. 41 42 however yeon gaesomun died of a natural cause in 666 and goguryeo was thrown into chaos and weakened by a succession struggle among his sons and younger brother with his eldest son defecting to tang and his younger brother defecting to silla 43 44 the tang-silla alliance finally conquered goguryeo in 668. after the collapse of goguryeo tang and silla ended their alliance and

transmitting advanced chinese culture to the japanese archipelago baekje was once a great military power on the korean peninsula most notably in the 4th century during the rule of geunchogo when its influence extended across the sea to liaoxi and shandong in china taking advantage of the weakened state of former qin and kyushu in the japanese archipelago 62 however baekje was critically defeated by gwanggaeto the great and declined 63 although later records claim that silla was the oldest of the three kingdoms of korea it is now believed to have been the last kingdom to develop by the 2nd century silla existed as a large state in the southeast occupying and influencing its neighboring city-states in 562, silla annexed the gaya confederacy which was located between baekje and silla the three kingdoms of korea often warred with each other and silla was often dominated by baekje and goguryeo silla was the smallest and weakest of the three but it used cunning diplomatic means to make opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful korean kingdoms and eventually tang china to its great advantage 64 65 in 660, king muyeol ordered his armies to attack baekje general kim yu-shin aided by tang forces conquered baekje after defeating general gyebaek at the battle of hwangsanbeol in 661, silla and tang attacked goguryeo but were repelled king munmu son of muyeol and

105 and the last empress of the yuan dynasty was a korean princess 106 in the 1350s king gongmin was free at last to reform the goryeo government when the yuan dynasty began to crumble gongmin had various problems that needed to be dealt with which included the removal of pro-mongol aristocrats and military officials the question of land holding and quelling the growing animosity between the buddhists and confucian scholars during this tumultuous period goryeo momentarily conquered liaoyang in 1356, repulsed two large invasions by the red turbans in 1359 and 1360, and defeated the final attempt by the yuan to dominate goryeo when general choe yeong defeated a mongol tumen in 1364. during the 1380s goryeo turned its attention to the wokou threat and used naval artillery created by
