policy funding method sociology technoscience outline portal category v t e the life sciences comprise the branches of science that involve the scientific study of living organisms – such as microorganisms plants animals and human beings – as well as related considerations like bioethics while biology remains the centerpiece of the life sciences technological advances in molecular biology and biotechnology have led to a burgeoning of specializations and interdisciplinary fields 1 2 some life sciences focus on a specific type of life for example zoology is the study of animals while botany is the study of plants other life sciences focus on aspects common to all or many life forms such as anatomy and genetics yet other fields are interested in technological advances involving living things such as bio-engineering another major though more specific branch of life sciences involves understanding the mind – neuroscience the life sciences are helpful in improving the quality and standard of life they have applications in health agriculture medicine and the pharmaceutical and food science industries there is considerable overlap between many of the topics of study in the life sciences biology and its branches edit main article outline of biology § branches of biology biology – burst and eclectic field composed of many branches and subdisciplines however despite the broad scope of biology there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research consolidating it into a single coherent field in general biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life genes as the basic unit of heredity and evolution as the engine that propels the synthesis and creation of new species it is also understood today that all organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environment to maintain a stable and vital condition here are some of biology s major branches anatomy – study of form and

related article that is used to diagnose prevent or treat disease or other conditions and does not achieve its purposes through chemical action within or on the body which would make it a drug  38 whereas medicinal products also called pharmaceuticals achieve their principal action by pharmacological metabolic or immunological means medical devices act by other means like physical mechanical or thermal means medical imaging – play media parasagittal mri of the head with aliasing artifacts nose and forehead appear at the back of the head medical imaging is the technique and process used to create images of the human body or parts and function thereof for clinical purposes medical procedures seeking to reveal diagnose or examine disease or medical science including the study of normal

pathology 39 examples of medical imaging include 40 x-rays ct scans ultrasound mri scan medical social work – medical social work is a sub-discipline of social work also known as hospital social work medical social workers typically work in a hospital skilled nursing facility or hospice have a graduate degree in the field and work with patients and their families in need of psychosocial help medical social workers assess the psychosocial functioning of patients and families and intervene as necessary interventions may include connecting patients and families to necessary resources and supports in the community providing psychotherapy supportive counselling or grief counselling or helping a patient to expand and strengthen their network of social supports neuroethology – neuroethology is the evolutionary and comparative approach study of animal behavior and the understanding of an animal s nervous system 41 optogenetics – optogenetics is a neuromodulation technique
