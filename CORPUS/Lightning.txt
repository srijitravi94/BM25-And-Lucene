sudden electrostatic discharge that occurs during a thunderstorm this discharge occurs between electrically charged regions of a cloud called intra-cloud lightning or ic  between two clouds cc lightning  or between a cloud and the ground cg lightning  the charged regions in the atmosphere temporarily equalize themselves through this discharge referred to as a flash a lightning flash can also be a strike if it involves an object on the ground lightning creates light in the form of black body radiation from the very hot plasma created by the electron flow and sound in the form of thunder lightning may be seen and not heard when it occurs at a distance too great for the sound to carry as far as the light from the strike or flash lightning electrification edit the main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in the central part of the storm where air is moving upward rapidly updraft and temperatures range from −15 to −25 celsius the details of the charging process are still being studied by scientists but there is general agreement on some of the basic concepts of thunderstorm electrification the main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in the central part of the storm where air is moving upward rapidly updraft and temperatures range from −15 to −25 celsius see figure to the right at that place the combination of temperature and rapid upward air movement produces a mixture of super-cooled cloud droplets small water droplets below freezing  small ice crystals and graupel soft hail  the updraft carries the super-cooled cloud droplets and very small ice crystals upward at the same time the graupel which is considerably larger and denser tends to fall or be suspended in the rising air 1 when the rising ice crystals collide with graupel soft hail  the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel becomes negatively charged the differences in the movement of the precipitation cause collisions to occur when the rising ice crystals collide with graupel soft hail  the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel becomes negatively charged see figure to the left the updraft carries the positively charged ice crystals upward toward the top of the storm cloud the larger and denser graupel is either suspended in the middle of the thunderstorm cloud or falls toward the lower part of the storm 1 the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes positively charged while the middle to lower part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes negatively charged the result is that the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes positively charged while the middle to lower part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes negatively charged 1 the upward motions within the storm and winds at higher levels in the atmosphere tend to cause the small ice crystals and positive charge in the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud to spread out horizontally some distance from thunderstorm cloud base this part of the thunderstorm cloud is called the anvil while this is the main charging process for the thunderstorm cloud some of these charges can be redistributed by air movements within the storm updrafts and downdrafts  in addition there is a small but important positive charge buildup near the bottom of the thunderstorm cloud due to the precipitation and warmer temperatures 1 general considerations edit play media four-second video of a lightning strike island in the sky canyonlands national park utah united states on earth the lightning frequency is approximately 40–50 times a second or nearly 1.4 billion flashes per year 2 and the average duration is 0.2 seconds made up from a number of much shorter flashes strokes of around 30 microseconds 3 many factors affect the frequency distribution strength and physical properties of a typical lightning flash in a particular region of the world these factors include ground elevation latitude prevailing wind currents relative humidity proximity to warm and cold bodies of water etc to a certain degree the ratio between ic cc and cg lightning may also vary by season in middle latitudes because human beings are terrestrial and most of their possessions are on the earth where lightning can damage or destroy them cg lightning is the most studied and best understood of the three types even though ic and cc are more common types of lightning lightning s relative unpredictability limits a complete explanation of how or why it occurs even after hundreds of years of scientific investigation a typical cloud-to-ground lightning flash culminates in the formation of an electrically conducting plasma channel through the air in excess of 5 kilometres 3.1 mi tall from within the cloud to the ground s surface the actual discharge is the final stage of a very complex process 4 at its peak a typical thunderstorm produces three or more strikes to the earth per minute 5 lightning primarily occurs when warm air is mixed with colder air masses 6 resulting in atmospheric disturbances necessary for polarizing the atmosphere citation needed however it can also occur during dust storms forest fires tornadoes volcanic eruptions and even in the cold of winter where the lightning is known as thundersnow 7 8 hurricanes typically generate some lightning mainly in the rainbands as much as 160 kilometres 99 mi from the center 9 10 11 the science of lightning is called fulminology and the fear of lightning is called astraphobia frequency edit main article distribution of lightning world map showing frequency of lightning strikes in flashes per km² per year equal-area projection  from combined 1995–2003 data from the optical transient detector and 1998–2003 data from the lightning imaging sensor lightning is not distributed evenly around the planet as shown in the map about 70 of lightning occurs over land in the tropics 12 where atmospheric convection is the greatest this occurs from both the mixture of warmer and colder air masses as well as differences in moisture concentrations and it generally happens at the boundaries between them the flow of warm ocean currents past drier land masses such as the gulf stream partially explains the elevated frequency of lightning in the southeast united states because the influence of small or absent land masses in the vast stretches of the world s oceans limits the differences between these variants in the atmosphere lightning is notably less frequent there than over larger landforms the north and south poles are limited in their coverage of thunderstorms and therefore result in areas with the least amount of lightning in general cloud-to-ground cg lightning flashes account for only 25 of all total lightning flashes worldwide since the base of a thunderstorm is usually negatively charged this is where most cg lightning originates this region is typically at the elevation where freezing occurs within the cloud freezing combined with collisions between ice and water appears to be a critical part of the initial charge development and separation process during wind-driven collisions ice crystals tend to develop a positive charge while a heavier slushy mixture of ice and water called graupel develops a negative charge updrafts within a storm cloud separate the lighter ice crystals from the heavier graupel causing the top region of the cloud to accumulate a positive space charge while the lower level accumulates a negative space charge lightning in belfort france because the concentrated charge within the cloud must exceed the insulating properties of air and this increases proportionally to the distance between the cloud and the ground the proportion of cg strikes versus cloud-to-cloud cc or in-cloud ic discharges becomes greater when the cloud is closer to the ground in the tropics where the freezing level is generally higher in the atmosphere only 10 of lightning flashes are cg at the latitude of norway around 60° north latitude  where the freezing elevation is lower 50 of lightning is cg 13 14 lightning is usually produced by cumulonimbus clouds which have bases that are typically 1–2 km 0.6–1.25 miles above the ground and tops up to 15 km 9.3 mi in height lightning hotspots the place on earth where lightning occurs most often is near the small village of kifuka in the mountains of the eastern democratic republic of the congo 15 where the elevation is around 975 m 3,200 ft  on average this region receives 158 lightning strikes per 1 square kilometer 0.39 sq mi per year 16 lake maracaibo in venezuela averages 297 days per year with lightning activity 17 other lightning hotspots include catatumbo in venezuela singapore 18 and lightning alley in central florida 19 20 necessary conditions edit main article thunderstorm sound of a thunderstorm in order for an electrostatic discharge to occur two preconditions are necessary firstly a sufficiently high electric potential between two regions of space must exist and secondly a high-resistance medium must obstruct the free unimpeded equalization of the opposite charges it is well understood that during a thunderstorm there is charge separation and aggregation in certain regions of the cloud however the exact processes by which this occurs are not fully understood 21 the atmosphere provides the electrical insulation or barrier that prevents free equalization between charged regions of opposite polarity this is overcome by lightning  a complex process referred to as the lightning flash  electrical field generation edit view of lightning from an airplane flying above a system as a thundercloud moves over the surface of the earth an equal electric charge but of opposite polarity is induced on the earth s surface underneath the cloud the induced positive surface charge when measured against a fixed point will be small as the thundercloud approaches increasing as the center of the storm arrives and dropping as the thundercloud passes the referential value of the induced surface charge could be roughly represented as a bell curve the oppositely charged regions create an electric field within the air between them this electric field varies in relation to the strength of the surface charge on the base of the thundercloud – the greater the accumulated charge the higher the electrical field flashes and strikes edit the best studied and understood form of lightning is cloud to ground cg  although more common intracloud ic and cloud to cloud cc flashes are very difficult to study given there are no physical points to monitor inside the clouds also given the very low probability lightning will strike the same point repeatedly and consistently scientific inquiry is difficult at best even in the areas of high cg frequency as such knowing flash propagation is similar amongst all forms of lightning the best means to describe the process is through an examination of the most studied form cloud to ground a lightning strike from cloud to ground in the california mojave desert an intracloud flash a lightning flash within the cloud illuminates the entire blanket lightning leaders edit a downward leader travels towards earth branching as it goes lightning strike caused by the connection of two leaders positive shown in blue and negative in red in a process not well understood a bidirectional channel of ionized air called a leader  is initiated between oppositely-charged regions in a thundercloud leaders are electrically conductive channels of ionized gas that propagate through or are otherwise attracted to regions with a charge opposite of that of the leader tip the negative end of the bidirectional leader fills a positive charge region also called a well inside the cloud while the positive end fills a negative charge well leaders often split forming branches in a tree-like pattern 22 in addition negative and some positive leaders travel in a discontinuous fashion in a process called stepping  the resulting jerky movement of the leaders can be readily observed in slow-motion videos of lightning flashes it is possible for one end of the leader to fill the oppositely-charged well entirely while the other end is still active when this happens the leader end which filled the well may propagate outside of the thundercloud and result in either a cloud-to-air flash or a cloud-to-ground flash in a typical cloud-to-ground flash a bidirectional leader initiates between the main negative and lower positive charge regions in a thundercloud the weaker positive charge region is filled quickly by the negative leader which then propagates toward the inductively-charged ground the positively and negatively charged leaders proceed in opposite directions positive upwards within the cloud and negative towards the earth both ionic channels proceed in their respective directions in a number of successive spurts each leader pools ions at the leading tips shooting out one or more new leaders momentarily pooling again to concentrate charged ions then shooting out another leader the negative leader continues to propagate and split as it heads downward often speeding up as it get closer to the earth s surface about 90 of ionic channel lengths between pools are approximately 45 m 148 ft in length 23 the establishment of the ionic channel takes a comparatively long amount of time hundreds of milliseconds in comparison to the resulting discharge which occurs within a few microseconds the electric current needed to establish the channel measured in the tens or hundreds of amperes is dwarfed by subsequent currents during the actual discharge initiation of the lightning leaders is not well understood the electric field strength within the thundercloud is not typically large enough to initiate this process by itself 24 many hypotheses have been proposed one theory postulates that showers of relativistic electrons are created by cosmic rays and are then accelerated to higher velocities via a process called runaway breakdown as these relativistic electrons collide and ionize neutral air molecules they initiate leader formation another theory invokes locally enhanced electric fields being formed near elongated water droplets or ice crystals 25 percolation theory especially for the case of biased percolation 26 clarification needed describes random connectivity phenomena which produce an evolution of connected structures similar to that of lightning strikes upward streamers edit when a stepped leader approaches the ground the presence of opposite charges on the ground enhances the strength of the electric field the electric field is strongest on grounded objects whose tops are closest to the base of the thundercloud such as trees and tall buildings if the electric field is strong enough a positively charged ionic channel called a positive or upward streamer can develop from these points this was first theorized by heinz kasemir 27 28 as negatively charged leaders approach increasing the localized electric field strength grounded objects already experiencing corona discharge exceed a threshold and form upward streamers attachment edit once a downward leader connects to an available upward leader a process referred to as attachment a low-resistance path is formed and discharge may occur photographs have been taken in which unattached streamers are clearly visible the unattached downward leaders are also visible in branched lightning none of which are connected to the earth although it may appear they are discharge edit return stroke edit high-speed photography showing different parts of a lightning flash during the discharge process as seen in toulouse france once a conductive channel bridges the air gap between the negative charge excess in the cloud and the positive surface charge excess below there is a large drop in resistance across the lightning channel electrons accelerate rapidly as a result in a zone beginning at the point of attachment which expands across the entire leader network at a fraction of the speed of light this is the return stroke and it is the most luminous and noticeable part of the lightning discharge a large electric current flows along the plasma channel from the cloud to the ground neutralising the positive ground charge as electrons flow away from the strike point to the surrounding area this huge surge of current creates large radial voltage differences along the surface of the ground called step potentials they are responsible for more injuries and deaths than the strike itself citation needed electricity takes every path available to it 29 a portion of the return stroke current will often preferentially flow through one leg and out another electrocuting an unlucky human or animal standing near the point where the lightning strikes the electric current of the return stroke averages 30 kiloamperes for a typical negative cg flash often referred to as negative cg lightning in some cases a ground to cloud gc lightning flash may originate from a positively charged region on the ground below a storm these discharges normally originate from the tops of very tall structures such as communications antennas the rate at which the return stroke current travels has been found to be around 1×108 m s 30 the massive flow of electric current occurring during the return stroke combined with the rate at which it occurs measured in microseconds rapidly superheats the completed leader channel forming a highly electrically conductive plasma channel the core temperature of the plasma during the return stroke may exceed 50,000 k causing it to brilliantly radiate with a blue-white color once the electric current stops flowing the channel cools and dissipates over tens or hundreds of milliseconds often disappearing as fragmented patches of glowing gas the nearly instantaneous heating during the return stroke causes the air to expand explosively producing a powerful shock wave which is heard as thunder re-strike edit high-speed videos examined frame-by-frame show that most negative cg lightning flashes are made up of 3 or 4 individual strokes though there may be as many as 30. 31 each re-strike is separated by a relatively large amount of time typically 40 to 50 milliseconds as other charged regions in the cloud are discharged in subsequent strokes re-strikes often cause a noticeable strobe light effect 32 to understand why multiple return strokes utilize the same lightning channel one needs to understand the behavior of positive leaders which a typical ground flash effectively becomes following the negative leader s connection with the ground positive leaders decay more rapidly than negative leaders do for reasons not well understood bidirectional leaders tend to initiate on the tips of the decayed positive leaders in which the negative end attempts to re-ionize the leader network these leaders also called recoil leaders usually decay shortly after their formation when they do manage to make contact with a conductive portion of the main leader network a return stroke-like process occurs and a dart leader travels across all or a portion of the length of the original leader the dart leaders making connections with the ground is what causes a majority of subsequent return strokes 33 each successive stroke is preceded by intermediate dart leader strokes that have a faster rise time but lower amplitude than the initial return stroke each subsequent stroke usually re-uses the discharge channel taken by the previous one but the channel may be offset from its previous position as wind displaces the hot channel 34 since recoil and dart leader processes do not occur on negative leaders subsequent return strokes very seldom utilize the same channel on positive ground flashes which are explained later in the article transient currents during flash edit the electric current within a typical negative cg lightning discharge rises very quickly to its peak value in 1–10 microseconds then decays more slowly over 50–200 microseconds the transient nature of the current within a lightning flash results in several phenomena that need to be addressed in the effective protection of ground-based structures rapidly changing currents tend to travel on the surface of a conductor in what is called the skin effect unlike direct currents which flow through the entire conductor like water through a hose hence conductors used in the protection of facilities tend to be multi-stranded with small wires woven together this increases the total bundle surface area in inverse proportion to the individual strand radius for a fixed total cross-sectional area the rapidly changing currents also create electromagnetic pulses emps that radiate outward from the ionic channel this is a characteristic of all electrical discharges the radiated pulses rapidly weaken as their distance from the origin increases however if they pass over conductive elements such as power lines communication lines or metallic pipes they may induce a current which travels outward to its termination this is the surge that more often than not results in the destruction of delicate electronics electrical appliances or electric motors devices known as surge protectors spd or transient voltage surge suppressors tvss attached in parallel with these lines can detect the lightning flash s transient irregular current and through an alteration of its physical properties route the spike to an attached earthing ground thereby protecting the equipment from damage types edit there are three primary types of lightning defined by what is at the ends of a flash channel intracloud ic  which occurs within a single thundercloud unit cloud to cloud cc or intercloud which starts and ends between two different functional thundercloud units cloud to ground cg  that primarily originates in the thundercloud and terminates on an earth surface but may also occur in the reverse direction that is ground to cloud there are variations of each type such as positive versus negative cg flashes that have different physical characteristics common to each which can be measured different common names used to describe a particular lightning event may be attributed to the same or different events cloud to ground cg edit cloud to ground lightning cloud-to-ground cg lightning is a lightning discharge between a thundercloud and the ground it is initiated by a stepped leader moving down from the cloud which met by a streamer moving up from the ground cg is the least common but best understood of all types of lightning it is easier to study scientifically because it terminates on a physical object namely the earth and lends itself to being measured by instruments on the ground of the three primary types of lightning it poses the greatest threat to life and property since it terminates or strikes the earth the overall discharge termed a flash is composed of a number of processes such as preliminary breakdown stepped leaders connecting leaders return strokes dart leaders and subsequent return strokes 35 positive and negative lightning edit cloud-to-ground cg lightning is either positive or negative as defined by the direction of the conventional electric current from cloud to ground most cg lightning is negative meaning that a negative charge is transferred to ground and electrons travel downward along the lightning channel the reverse happens in a positive cg flash where electrons travel upward along the lightning channel and a positive charge is transferred to the ground positive lightning is less common than negative lightning and on average makes up less than 5 of all lightning strikes 36 a bolt from the blue lightning strike which appears to initiate from the clear but turbulent sky above the anvil cloud and drive a bolt of plasma through the cloud directly to the ground they are commonly referred to as positive flashes despite the fact that they are usually negative in polarity there are six different mechanisms theorized to result in the formation of downward positive lightning 37 vertical wind shear displacing the upper positive charge region of a thundercloud exposing it to the ground below the loss of lower charge regions in the dissipating stage of a thunderstorm leaving the primary positive charge region a complex arrangement of charge regions in a thundercloud effectively resulting in an inverted dipole or inverted tripole in which the main negative charge region is above the main positive charge region instead of beneath it an unusually large lower positive charge region in the thundercloud cutoff of an extended negative leader from its origin which creates a new bidirectional leader in which the positive end strikes the ground commonly seen in anvil-crawler spider flashes the initiation of a downward positive branch from an intracloud lightning flash contrary to popular belief positive lightning flashes do not necessarily originate from the anvil or the upper positive charge region and strike a rain-free area outside of the thunderstorm this belief is based on the outdated idea that lightning leaders are unipolar in nature and originating from their respective charge region positive lightning strikes tend to be much more intense than their negative counterparts an average bolt of negative lightning carries an electric current of 30,000 amperes 30 ka  and transfers 15 coulombs of electric charge and 500 megajoules of energy large bolts of negative lightning can carry up to 120 ka and 350 coulombs 38 the average positive ground flash has roughly double the peak current of a typical negative flash and can produce peak currents up to 400,000 amperes 400 ka and charges of several hundreds coulombs 39 40 furthermore positive ground flashes with high peak currents are commonly followed by long continuing currents a correlation not seen in negative ground flashes 41 as a result of their greater power as well as lack of warning positive lightning strikes are considerably more dangerous due to the aforementioned tendency for positive ground flashes to produce both high peak currents and long continuing current they are capable of heating surfaces to much higher levels which increases the likelihood of a fire being ignited at the present time aircraft are not designed to withstand such strikes since their existence was unknown at the time standards were set and the dangers unappreciated until the destruction of a glider in 1999. 42 the standard in force at the time of the crash advisory circular ac 20-53a was replaced by advisory circular ac 20-53b in 2006, 43 however it is unclear whether adequate protection against positive lightning was incorporated 44 45 aircraft operating in u.s airspace have been required to be equipped with static discharge wicks although their primary function is to mitigate radio interference due to static buildup through friction with the air in the event of a lightning strike a plane is designed to conduct the excess electricity through its skin and structure to the wicks to be safely discharged back into the atmosphere these measures however may be insufficient for positive lightning 46 positive lightning has also been shown to trigger the occurrence of upward lightning flashes from the tops of tall structures and is largely responsible for the initiation of sprites several tens of kilometers above ground level positive lightning tends to occur more frequently in winter storms as with thundersnow during intense tornadoes 47 and in the dissipation stage of a thunderstorm 48 huge quantities of extremely low frequency elf and very low frequency vlf radio waves are also generated 49 a unique form of cloud-to-ground lightning exists where lightning appears to exit from the cumulonimbus cloud and propagate a considerable distance through clear air before veering towards and striking the ground for this reason they are known as bolts from the blue  despite the popular misconception that these are positive lightning strikes due to them seemingly originating from the positive charge region observations have shown that these are in fact negative flashes they begin as intracloud flashes within the cloud the negative leader then exits the cloud from the positive charge region before propagating through clear air and striking the ground some distance away 50 51 cloud to cloud cc and intra-cloud ic edit branching of cloud to cloud lightning new delhi india multiple paths of cloud-to-cloud lightning swifts creek australia cloud-to-cloud lightning victoria australia cloud-to-cloud lightning seen in gresham oregon lightning discharges may occur between areas of cloud without contacting the ground when it occurs between two separate clouds it is known as inter-cloud lightning and when it occurs between areas of differing electric potential within a single cloud it is known as intra-cloud lightning intra-cloud lightning is the most frequently occurring type 48 intra-cloud lightning most commonly occurs between the upper anvil portion and lower reaches of a given thunderstorm this lightning can sometimes be observed at great distances at night as so-called sheet lightning  in such instances the observer may see only a flash of light without hearing any thunder anvil crawler over lake wright patman south of redwater texas on the backside of a large area of rain associated with a cold-front another term used for cloud–cloud or cloud–cloud–ground lightning is anvil crawler  due to the habit of charge typically originating beneath or within the anvil and scrambling through the upper cloud layers of a thunderstorm often generating dramatic multiple branch strokes these are usually seen as a thunderstorm passes over the observer or begins to decay the most vivid crawler behavior occurs in well developed thunderstorms that feature extensive rear anvil shearing observational variations edit anvil crawler lightning sometimes called spider lightning is created when leaders propagate through horizontally-extensive charge regions in mature thunderstorms usually the stratiform regions of mesoscale convective systems these discharges usually begin as intracloud discharges originating within the convective region the negative leader end then propagates well into the aforementioned charge regions in the stratiform area if the leader becomes too long it may separate into multiple bidirectional leaders when this happens the positive end of the separated leader may strike the ground as a positive cg flash and or crawl on the underside of the cloud creating a spectacular display of lightning crawling across the sky ground flashes produced in this manner tend to transfer high amounts of charge and this can trigger upward lightning flashes and upper-atmospheric lightning 52 ball lightning may be an atmospheric electrical phenomenon the physical nature of which is still controversial the term refers to reports of luminous usually spherical objects which vary from pea-sized to several meters in diameter 53 it is sometimes associated with thunderstorms but unlike lightning flashes which last only a fraction of a second ball lightning reportedly lasts many seconds ball lightning has been described by eyewitnesses but rarely recorded by meteorologists 54 55 scientific data on natural ball lightning is scarce owing to its infrequency and unpredictability the presumption of its existence is based on reported public sightings and has therefore produced somewhat inconsistent findings brett porter 56 wildlife ranger reported having taken a photo at queensland of australia in 1987. bead lightning is the decaying stage of a lightning channel in which the luminosity of the channel breaks up into segments nearly every lightning discharge will exhibit beading as the channel cools immediately after a return stroke sometimes referred to as the lightning s bead-out stage bead lightning is more properly a stage of a normal lightning discharge rather than a type of lightning in itself beading of a lightning channel is usually a small-scale feature and therefore is often only apparent when the observer camera is close to the lightning 57 cloud-to-air lightning is a lightning flash in which one end of a bidirectional leader exits the cloud but does not result in a ground flash such flashes can sometimes be thought of as failed ground flashes blue jets and gigantic jets are a form of cloud-to-air or cloud-to-ionosphere lightning where a leader is launched from the top of a thunderstorm dry lightning is used in australia canada and the united states for lightning that occurs with no precipitation at the surface this type of lightning is the most common natural cause of wildfires 58 pyrocumulus clouds produce lightning for the same reason that it is produced by cumulonimbus clouds citation needed  forked lightning is cloud-to-ground lightning that exhibits branching of its path heat lightning is a lightning flash that appears to produce no discernible thunder because it occurs too far away for the thunder to be heard the sound waves dissipate before they reach the observer 59 ribbon lightning occurs in thunderstorms with high cross winds and multiple return strokes the wind will blow each successive return stroke slightly to one side of the previous return stroke causing a ribbon effect 60 rocket lightning is a form of cloud discharge generally horizontal and at cloud base with a luminous channel appearing to advance through the air with visually resolvable speed often intermittently 61 sheet lightning is cloud-to-cloud lightning that exhibits a diffuse brightening of the surface of a cloud caused by the actual discharge path being hidden or too far away the lightning itself cannot be seen by the spectator so it appears as only a flash or a sheet of light the lightning may be too far away to discern individual flashes smooth channel lightning is an informal term referring to a type of cloud-to-ground lightning strike that has no visible branching and appears like a line with smooth curves as opposed to the jagged appearance of most lightning channels they are a form of positive lightning generally observed in or near the convective regions of severe thunderstorms in the north central united states it is theorized that severe thunderstorms in this region obtain an inverted tripole charge structure in which the main positive charge region is located below the main negative charge region instead of above it and as a result these thunderstorms generate predominantly positive cloud-to-ground lightning the term smooth channel lightning is also sometimes attributed to upward ground-to-cloud lightning flashes which are generally negative flashes initiated by upward positive leaders from tall structures staccato lightning is a cloud-to-ground lightning cg strike which is a short-duration stroke that often but not always appears as a single very bright flash and often has considerable branching 62 these are often found in the visual vault area near the mesocyclone of rotating thunderstorms and coincides with intensification of thunderstorm updrafts a similar cloud-to-cloud strike consisting of a brief flash over a small area appearing like a blip also occurs in a similar area of rotating updrafts 63 this cg was of very short duration exhibited highly branched channels and was very bright indicating that it was staccato lightning near new boston texas superbolts are bolts of lightning around a hundred times brighter than normal on earth one in a million lightning strikes is a superbolt 64 65 sympathetic lightning is the tendency of lightning to be loosely coordinated across long distances discharges can appear in clusters when viewed from space upward lightning or ground-to-cloud lightning is a lightning flash which originates from the top of a grounded object and propagates upward from this point this type of lightning can be triggered by a preceding lightning flash or it may initiate entirely on its own the former is generally found in regions where spider lightning occurs and may involve multiple grounded objects simultaneously the latter usually occurs during the cold season and may be the dominant lightning type in thundersnow events 66 clear-air lightning describes lightning that occurs with no apparent cloud close enough to have produced it in the u.s and canadian rockies a thunderstorm can be in an adjacent valley and not observable from the valley where the lightning bolt strikes either visually or audibly european and asian mountainous areas experience similar events also in areas such as sounds large lakes or open plains when the storm cell is on the near horizon within 26 kilometres 16 mi there may be some distant activity a strike can occur and as the storm is so far away the strike is referred to as a bolt from the blue 67 these flashes usually begin as normal intracloud lightning flashes before the negative leader exits the cloud and strikes the ground a considerable distance away 50 51 positive clear-air strikes can occur in highly-sheared environments where the upper positive charge region becomes horizontally displaced from the precipitation area 68 effects edit lightning strike edit main article lightning strike objects struck by lightning experience heat and magnetic forces of great magnitude the heat created by lightning currents traveling through a tree may vaporize its sap causing a steam explosion that bursts the trunk as lightning travels through sandy soil the soil surrounding the plasma channel may melt forming tubular structures called fulgurites even though roughly 90 percent of people struck by lightning survive 69 humans or animals struck by lightning may suffer severe injury due to internal organ and nervous system damage buildings or tall structures hit by lightning may be damaged as the lightning seeks unintended paths to ground by safely conducting a lightning strike to ground a lightning protection system can greatly reduce the probability of severe property damage lightning also serves an important role in the nitrogen cycle by oxidizing diatomic nitrogen in the air into nitrates which are deposited by rain and can fertilize the growth of plants and other organisms 70 71 thunder edit main article thunder because the electrostatic discharge of terrestrial lightning superheats the air to plasma temperatures along the length of the discharge channel in a short duration kinetic theory dictates gaseous molecules undergo a rapid increase in pressure and thus expand outward from the lightning creating a shock wave audible as thunder since the sound waves propagate not from a single point source but along the length of the lightning s path the sound origin s varying distances from the observer can generate a rolling or rumbling effect perception of the sonic characteristics is further complicated by factors such as the irregular and possibly branching geometry of the lightning channel by acoustic echoing from terrain and by the typically multiple-stroke characteristic of the lightning strike light travels at about 300,000,000 m s and sound travels through air at about 340 m s an observer can approximate the distance to the strike by timing the interval between the visible lightning and the audible thunder it generates a lightning flash preceding its thunder by one second would be approximately 340 metres 0.21 mi in distance a delay of three seconds would indicate a distance of about one kilometer 0.62 mi 3×340 m  a flash preceding thunder by five seconds would indicate a distance of approximately one mile 1.6 km 5×340 m  consequently a lightning strike observed at a very close distance will be accompanied by a sudden clap of thunder with almost no perceptible time lapse possibly accompanied by the smell of ozone o3  high-energy radiation edit the production of x-rays by a bolt of lightning was theoretically predicted as early as 1925 72 but no evidence was found until 2001 2002, 73 74 75 when researchers at the new mexico institute of mining and technology detected x-ray emissions from an induced lightning strike along a grounded wire trailed behind a rocket shot into a storm cloud in the same year university of florida and florida tech researchers used an array of electric field and x-ray detectors at a lightning research facility in north florida to confirm that natural lightning makes x-rays in large quantities during the propagation of stepped leaders the cause of the x-ray emissions is still a matter for research as the temperature of lightning is too low to account for the x-rays observed 76 77 a number of observations by space-based telescopes have revealed even higher energy gamma ray emissions the so-called terrestrial gamma-ray flashes tgfs  these observations pose a challenge to current theories of lightning especially with the recent discovery of the clear signatures of antimatter produced in lightning 78 recent research has shown that secondary species produced by these tgfs such as electrons positrons neutrons or protons can gain energies of up to several tens of mev 79 80 volcanic edit volcanic material thrust high into the atmosphere can trigger lightning volcanic activity produces lightning-friendly conditions in multiple ways the enormous quantity of pulverized material and gases explosively ejected into the atmosphere creates a dense plume of particles the ash density and constant motion within the volcanic plume produces charge by frictional interactions triboelectrification  resulting in very powerful and very frequent flashes as the cloud attempts to neutralize itself due to the extensive solid material ash content unlike the water rich charge generating zones of a normal thundercloud it is often called a dirty thunderstorm powerful and frequent flashes have been witnessed in the volcanic plume as far back as the 79 ad eruption of vesuvius by pliny the younger 81 likewise vapors and ash originating from vents on the volcano s flanks may produce more localized and smaller flashes upwards of 2.9 km long small short duration sparks recently documented near newly extruded magma attest to the material being highly charged prior to even entering the atmosphere 82 extraterrestrial edit lightning has been observed within the atmospheres of other planets such as jupiter and saturn although in the minority on earth superbolts appear to be common on jupiter lightning on venus has been a controversial subject after decades of study during the soviet venera and u.s pioneer missions of the 1970s and 1980s signals suggesting lightning may be present in the upper atmosphere were detected 83 although the cassini–huygens mission fly-by of venus in 1999 detected no signs of lightning the observation window lasted mere hours radio pulses recorded by the spacecraft venus express which began orbiting venus in april 2006 may originate from lightning on venus human-related phenomena edit airplane contrails have also been observed to influence lightning to a small degree the water vapor-dense contrails of airplanes may provide a lower resistance pathway through the atmosphere having some influence upon the establishment of an ionic pathway for a lightning flash to follow 84 rocket exhaust plumes provided a pathway for lightning when it was witnessed striking the apollo 12 rocket shortly after takeoff thermonuclear explosions by providing extra material for electrical conduction and a very turbulent localized atmosphere have been seen triggering lightning flashes within the mushroom cloud in addition intense gamma radiation from large nuclear explosions may develop intensely charged regions in the surrounding air through compton scattering the intensely charged space charge regions create multiple clear-air lightning discharges shortly after the device detonates 85 scientific study edit properties edit thunder is heard as a rolling gradually dissipating rumble because the sound from different portions of a long stroke arrives at slightly different times 86 when the local electric field exceeds the dielectric strength of damp air about 3 million volts per meter  electrical discharge results in a strike often followed by commensurate discharges branching from the same path see image right mechanisms that cause the charges to build up to lightning are still a matter of scientific investigation 87 88 new study confirming dielectric breakdown is involved rison 2016. lightning may be caused by the circulation of warm moisture-filled air through electric fields 89 ice or water particles then accumulate charge as in a van de graaff generator 90 researchers at the university of florida found that the final one-dimensional speeds of 10 flashes observed were between 1.0×105 and 1.4×106 m s with an average of 4.4×105 m s 91 detection and monitoring edit lightning strike counter in a museum main article lightning detection the earliest detector invented to warn of the approach of a thunder storm was the lightning bell benjamin franklin installed one such device in his house 92 93 the detector was based on an electrostatic device called the electric chimes invented by andrew gordon in 1742. lightning discharges generate a wide range of electromagnetic radiations including radio-frequency pulses the times at which a pulse from a given lightning discharge arrives at several receivers can be used to locate the source of the discharge the united states federal government has constructed a nationwide grid of such lightning detectors allowing lightning discharges to be tracked in real time throughout the continental u.s 94 95 the earth-ionosphere waveguide traps electromagnetic vlf- and elf waves electromagnetic pulses transmitted by lightning strikes propagate within that waveguide the waveguide is dispersive which means that their group velocity depends on frequency the difference of the group time delay of a lightning pulse at adjacent frequencies is proportional to the distance between transmitter and receiver together with direction finding methods this allows to locate lightning strikes up to distances of 10,000 km from their origin moreover the eigenfrequencies of the earth-ionospheric waveguide the schumann resonances at about 7.5 hz are used to determine the global thunderstorm activity 96 in addition to ground-based lightning detection several instruments aboard satellites have been constructed to observe lightning distribution these include the optical transient detector otd  aboard the orbview-1 satellite launched on april 3, 1995, and the subsequent lightning imaging sensor lis aboard trmm launched on november 28, 1997. 97 98 99 artificially triggered edit rocket-triggered lightning can be triggered by launching specially designed rockets trailing spools of wire into thunderstorms the wire unwinds as the rocket ascends creating an elevated ground that can attract descending leaders if a leader attaches the wire provides a low-resistance pathway for a lightning flash to occur the wire is vaporized by the return current flow creating a straight lightning plasma channel in its place this method allows for scientific research of lightning to occur under a more controlled and predictable manner 100 the international center for lightning research and testing iclrt at camp blanding florida typically uses rocket triggered lightning in their research studies laser-triggered since the 1970s 101 102 103 104 105 106 researchers have attempted to trigger lightning strikes by means of infrared or ultraviolet lasers which create a channel of ionized gas through which the lightning would be conducted to ground such triggering of lightning is intended to protect rocket launching pads electric power facilities and other sensitive targets 107 108 109 110 111 in new mexico u.s. scientists tested a new terawatt laser which provoked lightning scientists fired ultra-fast pulses from an extremely powerful laser thus sending several terawatts into the clouds to call down electrical discharges in storm clouds over the region the laser beams sent from the laser make channels of ionized molecules known as filaments  before the lightning strikes earth the filaments lead electricity through the clouds playing the role of lightning rods researchers generated filaments that lived a period too short to trigger a real lightning strike nevertheless a boost in electrical activity within the clouds was registered according to the french and german scientists who ran the experiment the fast pulses sent from the laser will be able to provoke lightning strikes on demand 112 statistical analysis showed that their laser pulses indeed enhanced the electrical activity in the thundercloud where it was aimed—in effect they generated small local discharges located at the position of the plasma channels 113 physical manifestations edit lightning-induced remanent magnetization lirm mapped during a magnetic field gradient survey of an archaeological site located in wyoming united states magnetism edit the movement of electrical charges produces a magnetic field see electromagnetism  the intense currents of a lightning discharge create a fleeting but very strong magnetic field where the lightning current path passes through rock soil or metal these materials can become permanently magnetized this effect is known as lightning-induced remanent magnetism or lirm these currents follow the least resistive path often horizontally near the surface 114 115 but sometimes vertically where faults ore bodies or ground water offers a less resistive path 116 one theory suggests that lodestones natural magnets encountered in ancient times were created in this manner 117 lightning-induced magnetic anomalies can be mapped in the ground 118 119 and analysis of magnetized materials can confirm lightning was the source of the magnetization 120 and provide an estimate of the peak current of the lightning discharge 121 solar wind and cosmic rays edit some high energy cosmic rays produced by supernovas as well as solar particles from the solar wind enter the atmosphere and electrify the air which may create pathways for lightning bolts 122 in culture and religion edit further information lightning in religion lightning by mikalojus konstantinas ciurlionis 1909 in many cultures lightning has been viewed as part of a deity or a deity in and of itself these include the greek god zeus the aztec god tlaloc the mayan god k slavic mythology s perun the baltic pērkons perkūnas thor in norse mythology ukko in finnish mythology the hindu god indra and the shinto god raijin 123 in the traditional religion of the african bantu tribes lightning is a sign of the ire of the gods verses in the jewish religion and in islam also ascribe supernatural importance to lightning in christianity the second coming of jesus is compared to lightning matthew 24 27 luke 17 24 the expression lightning never strikes twice in the same place is similar to opportunity never knocks twice in the vein of a once in a lifetime opportunity i.e. something that is generally considered improbable lightning occurs frequently and more so in specific areas since various factors alter the probability of strikes at any given location repeat lightning strikes have a very low probability but are not impossible  124 125 similarly a bolt from the blue refers to something totally unexpected some political parties use lightning flashes as a symbol of power such as the people s action party in singapore the british union of fascists during the 1930s and the national states rights party in the united states during the 1950s 126 the schutzstaffel the paramilitary wing of the nazi party used the sig rune in their logo which symbolizes lightning the german word blitzkrieg which means lightning war  was a major offensive strategy of the german army during world war ii in french and italian the expression for love at first sight is coup de foudre and colpo di fulmine respectively which literally translated means lightning strike  some european languages have a separate word for lightning which strikes the ground as opposed to lightning in general often it is a cognate of the english word rays  the name of new zealand s most celebrated thoroughbred horse phar lap derives from the shared zhuang and thai word for lightning 127 the bolt of lightning in heraldry is called a thunderbolt and is shown as a zigzag with non-pointed ends this symbol usually represents power and speed the lightning bolt is used to represent the instantaneous communication capabilities of electrically powered telegraphs and radios it was a commonly used motif in art deco design especially the zig-zag art deco design of the late 1920s 128 the lightning bolt is a common insignia for military communications units throughout the world a lightning bolt is also the nato symbol for a signal asset the unicode symbol for lightning is ☇ u 2607
