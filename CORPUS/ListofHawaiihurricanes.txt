effect on the state of hawaiʻi pre–1950 edit september 1843 the earliest report of a tropical cyclone that could have affected hawaiʻi was made in 1843. on september 23, a german ship recorded a cyclone known later as the cyclone of the lark near 17°n and 141°w no further records are available but extrapolation of its forward movement predicted that it would make landfall on the southern coast of the big island of hawaiʻi 2 august 1871 excerpts from a honolulu newsletter known as the hawaiian gazette described an august weather event that at least resembled a tropical cyclone quotes from captains and civilians describe a severe windstorm that ravaged the islands for several hours damage is unrecorded 2 november 1874 in november a possible tropical cyclone may have dropped over 20 inches 510 mm of rain on honolulu and southerly gales destroyed 23 homes and damaged at least 50. 2 december 1902–03 a low pressure system known later as the froc cyclone that took a path similar to

miles 140 km south of honolulu on november 3, 1906, a tropical cyclone was recognized the storm supposedly tracked northward passing through the kauai channel this cyclone must have been abnormally

pacific 140° w to 180 ° w generally travel from east to west however some including hurricanes iwa 1982 and iniki 1992 track in a northerly direction the islands of hawaii with kauai as the notable exception appear to be remarkably immune from direct hurricane hits the usgs states that more commonly near-misses that generate large swell and moderately high winds causing varying degrees of damage are the hallmark of hurricanes passing close to the islands 31 this has also drawn media attention 32 33 one notion is that hawaii’s volcanic peaks slow down or divert storms 34 a partial source of this idea may be the long list of hurricanes in the above paragraphs that dissipated into tropical storms or depressions upon approaching the islands satellite images of hurricane flossie s breakup when approaching hawaii island fueled this idea 35 another example may be hurricane felicia which dropped from category 4 down to a tropical depression with residual winds predicted at only 35 miles per hour 56 km h  36 snow on mauna loa and mauna kea after storm passes hawaii island tropical storm flossie not to be confused with hurricane flossie in 2007 provides still another example on july 28, 2013, the storm appeared headed for a direct hit to the big island home to mauna kea and mauna loa both mountains rise to elevations in excess of 13,000 feet above sea level and as flossie approached the island its track shifted abruptly overnight and assumed a more northerly alignment heading instead to the island of maui on july 29. 37 wind data in particular supports the usgs assertion that hurricane damage has been low on all islands except for kauai data collected by the western regional climate center show no hurricane-strength winds on any hawaii islands with the exception of kauai 38 despite this data fema classified all of hawaii as being in a wind-borne debris region  39 40 41 before hurricane iniki in 1992, a standard homeowner s insurance policy with extended coverage provided hurricane coverage since iniki many insurance policies exclude hurricane and a separate hurricane policy is required to obtain hurricane coverage
