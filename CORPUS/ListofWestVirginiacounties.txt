of them existed at the time of the wheeling convention in 1861, before which west virginia was part of the commonwealth of virginia 1 the remaining five grant mineral lincoln summers and mingo were formed within the state 1 after its admission to the united states on june 20, 1863. 2 at that time berkeley county and jefferson county the two easternmost counties of west virginia refused to recognize their inclusion in the state in march 1866, the united states congress passed a joint mandate assenting to their inclusion 3 the west virginia constitution was ratified in 1872, replacing the state constitution created in 1863 when west virginia became a state 4 article 9, section 8, of the west virginia constitution permits the creation of additional counties if a majority of citizens in the proposed new county vote for its creation and the new county has a minimum area of 400 square miles 1,036 km2 and a population of at least 6,000. creation of a new county is prohibited if it would bring another county below these thresholds 5 three counties greenbrier kanawha and randolph have sufficient population and land area to allow a new county to be split off 5 6 7 the remaining counties cannot be split as either their land area would decrease to under 400 square miles 1,036 km2 or their population would decrease to below 6,000. 5 6 7 population figures are based on the 2010 united states census the role of counties in local government had been minimized under the 1863 constitution which vested most local government authority in a system of townships based on the new england model the authors of the 1872 constitution chose to return to the system used in virginia in which each county was governed by a county court with combined authority for executive legislative and judicial functions of the county government 8 in 1880, west virginia amended its constitution and replaced the county court system with an arrangement that divides county government powers between seven county offices each of which is independently elected the county commission county clerk circuit clerk county sheriff county assessor county prosecuting attorney and county surveyor of lands 9 counties have only those powers that are expressly granted to them by the state constitution or by state statute these powers include but are not limited to maintaining the infrastructure of the state funding libraries maintaining jails and hospitals and waste disposal 9 reforming public education became a county function in 1933. in may 1933, a county unit plan was adopted under this plan the state s 398 school districts were consolidated into the current 55 county school systems this enabled public schools to be funded more economically and saved west virginia millions of dollars 10
