list of retired australian cyclone names - wikipedia list of retired australian cyclone names from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search satellite image of cyclone monica the strongest recorded tropical cyclone in the australian region by wind speed tropical cyclones are non-frontal low pressure systems that develop within an environment of warm sea surface temperatures and little vertical wind shear aloft 1 within the australian region names are assigned from three pre-determined lists to such systems once they reach or exceed ten–minute sustained wind speeds of 65 km h 40 mph  near the center by either the bureau of meteorology or by the tropical cyclone warning centers in jakarta indonesia and port moresby papua new guinea 1 within the australian region tropical cyclones have been officially named since the 1963–64 australian region cyclone season though several meteorological papers show that a few tropical cyclones were named before 1964–65 2 3 4 the names of significant tropical cyclones that cause a high amount of damage and or loss of life are retired from the lists of tropical cyclone names by either the bureau of meteorology or the world meteorological organization s ra v tropical cyclone committee at their bi-annual meeting storms named by port moresby are automatically retired regardless of their impact due to their infrequent occurrence 1 within the australian region there have been a total of 113 tropical cyclone names retired with the 1990s accounting for 44 of these two of the most intense systems ever recorded in the southern hemisphere cyclones gwenda and inigo each attaining a barometric pressure of 900 hpa 26.58 inhg  are among the retired storms the deadliest cyclone to take place since the 1960s was cyclone guba in 2007 which killed 149 people in papua new guinea additionally the most damaging system was severe tropical cyclone tracy in 1974 which devastated the city of darwin leaving a 837 million a

the region the credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the queensland government meteorologist clement wragge who named systems between 1887 - 1907. 5 wragge used names drawn from the letters of the greek alphabet greek and roman mythology and female names to describe weather systems including tropical cyclones over australia new zealand and the antarctic 5 after the new australian government had failed to create a federal weather bureau and appoint him director wragge started naming cyclones after political figures 6 this system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after wragge retired before the australian bureau of meteorology started to use female names for tropical cyclones in the region during the 1963-64 cyclone season 5 during the international women s year of 1975 the australian science minister ordered that tropical cyclones within the australian region should carry both men s and women s names 5 this was because the minister thought that both sexes should bear the odium of the devastation caused by cyclones 5 as a result male names were added to the lists of names for both basins ahead of the 1975-76 season 5 7 the practice of retiring significant names was started during 1955 by the united states weather bureau in the northern atlantic basin after hurricanes carol edna and hazel struck the northeastern united states and caused a significant amount of damage in the previous year 8 initially the names were only designed to be retired for ten years after which they might be reintroduced however it was decided at the 1969 interdepartmental hurricane conference that any significant hurricane in the future would have its name permanently retired 8 9 several names have been removed from the pacific naming lists for various other reasons than causing a significant amount of death destruction which include being pronounced in a very similar way to other names and political reasons 10 11 tropical cyclone names retired in the 1960s edit there were 3 tropical cyclone names retired during the 1960s after the naming of tropical cyclones had restarted during the
