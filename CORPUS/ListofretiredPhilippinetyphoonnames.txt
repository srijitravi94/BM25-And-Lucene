agencies assigned names to tropical cyclones when they intensified into a tropical storm since 1963 the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa has assigned local names to a tropical cyclone should it move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°e and 115°e and between 5°n-25°n even if the cyclone has had
