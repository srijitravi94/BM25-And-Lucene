maryland the catholic george calvert 1st lord baltimore 1579–1632  sought a charter from king charles i for the territory between massachusetts to the north and virginia to the immediate south 54 after george calvert died in april 1632, the charter was granted to his son cecilius calvert 2nd baron baltimore 1605–1675  on june 20, 1632. officially the new maryland colony was named in honor of henrietta maria of france wife of charles i of england 55 alternatively some catholic scholars and historians believe maryland may have been named after mary the mother of jesus by george calvert 1st lord baltimore prior to his death in 1632. his original intent may never fully be known the specific name given in the charter was phrased terra mariae anglice maryland the english name was preferred due to undesired associations of mariae with the spanish jesuit juan de mariana linked to the inquisition in addition henrietta was never referred to by both her first and middle name scholars also agree that under no circumstances was a territory ever named after someone s middle name many agree who that since the original capital of maryland was st mary s city on the north shore of the potomac river – and the county surrounding it the first erected created in the province 56 was named st mary s county – maryland was most likely named after mary the mother of jesus christ the great seal of maryland also supports this conclusion the obverse side of the seal reads terræ mariæ 57 which translates in latin as land of mary instead of terræ maria which would acknowledge henrietta s middle name 58 lord baltimore s first settlers arrived in the new colony in march 1634, with his younger brother leonard calvert 1606–1647  as first provincial governor of maryland they made their first permanent settlement at st mary s city in what is now st mary s county they purchased the site from the paramount chief of the region who was eager to establish trade st mary s became the first capital of maryland and remained so for 60 years until 1695. more settlers soon followed their tobacco crops were successful and quickly made the new colony profitable however given the incidence of

pro-parliament puritan richard ingle took over st mary s 62 both used religion as a tool to gain popular support the two years from 1644–1646 that claiborne and his puritan associates held sway were known as the plundering time  they captured jesuit priests imprisoned them then sent them back to england in 1646 leonard calvert returned with troops recaptured st mary s city and restored order the house of delegates passed the act concerning religion in 1649 granting religious liberty to all trinitarian christians 59 in 1650 the puritans revolted against the proprietary government protestants swept the catholics out of the legislature ..and religious strife returned  59 the puritans set up a new government prohibiting both roman catholicism and anglicanism the puritan revolutionary government persecuted maryland catholics during its reign known as the plundering time  mobs burned down all the original catholic churches of southern maryland the puritan rule lasted until 1658 when

boundary dispute and cresap s war the royal charter granted maryland the land north of the potomac river up to the 40th parallel a problem arose when charles ii granted a charter for pennsylvania the grant defined pennsylvania s southern border as identical to maryland s northern border the 40th parallel but the grant indicated that charles ii and william penn assumed the 40th parallel would pass close to new castle delaware when it falls north of philadelphia the site of which penn had already selected for his colony s capital city negotiations ensued after the problem was discovered in 1681. a compromise proposed by charles ii in 1682 was undermined by penn s receiving the additional grant of what is now delaware 63 penn successfully argued that the maryland charter entitled lord baltimore only to unsettled lands and dutch settlement in delaware predated his charter the dispute remained unresolved for nearly a century carried on by the descendants of william penn and lord baltimore — the calvert family which controlled maryland and the penn family which controlled pennsylvania 63 the border dispute with pennsylvania led to cresap s war in the 1730s hostilities erupted in 1730 and escalated through the first half of the decade culminating in the deployment of military forces by maryland in 1736 and by pennsylvania in 1737. the armed phase of the conflict ended in may 1738 with the intervention of king george ii who compelled the negotiation of a cease-fire a provisional agreement had been established in 1732. 63 negotiations continued until a final agreement was signed in 1760. the agreement defined the border between maryland and pennsylvania as the line of latitude now known as the mason–dixon line maryland s border with delaware was based on a

regained power in the state from republicans democrats replaced the constitution of 1864 with the constitution of 1867. following the end of reconstruction in 1877, democrats devised means of disfranchising blacks initially by physical intimidation and voter fraud later by constitutional amendments and laws blacks and immigrants however resisted democratic party disfranchisement efforts in the state maryland blacks were part of a biracial republican coalition elected to state government in 1896–1904 and comprised 20 of the electorate 71 compared to some other states blacks were better established both before and after the civil war nearly half the population was free before the war and some had accumulated property half the population lived in cities literacy was high among blacks

early 20th century edit the progressive era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries brought political reforms in a series of laws passed between 1892 and 1908, reformers worked for standard state-issued ballots rather than those distributed and marked by the parties obtained closed voting booths to prevent party workers from assisting voters initiated primary elections to keep party bosses from selecting candidates and had candidates listed without party symbols which discouraged the illiterate from participating these measures worked against ill-educated whites and blacks blacks resisted such efforts with suffrage groups conducting voter education blacks defeated three efforts to disfranchise them making alliances with immigrants to resist various democratic campaigns 71 disfranchising bills in 1905, 1907, and 1911 were rebuffed in large part because of black opposition blacks comprised 20 of the electorate and immigrants comprised 15  and the legislature had difficulty devising requirements against blacks that did not also disadvantage immigrants 71 the progressive era also brought reforms in working conditions for maryland s labor force in 1902 the state regulated conditions in mines outlawed child laborers under the age of 12 mandated compulsory school attendance and enacted the nation s first workers compensation law the workers compensation law was overturned in the courts but was redrafted and finally enacted in 1910. the great baltimore fire of 1904 burned over 30 hours destroying 1,526 buildings and spanning 70 city blocks more than 1,231
