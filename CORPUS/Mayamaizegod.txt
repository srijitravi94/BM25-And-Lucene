maya maize god - wikipedia maya maize god from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search fig 1 tonsured maize god as a patron of the scribal arts classic period like other mesoamerican people the traditional mayas recognize in their staple crop maize a vital force with which they strongly identify this is clearly shown by their mythological traditions according to the 16th-century popol vuh the hero twins have maize plants for alter egos and man himself is created from maize the discovery and opening of the maize mountain - the place where the corn seeds are hidden - is still one of the most popular of maya tales in the classic period 200-900 ad  the maize deity shows aspects of a culture hero female and male maize deities edit in mayan oral tradition maize is usually personified as a woman 1 - like rice in southeast asia or wheat in ancient greece and rome the acquisition of this woman through bridal capture constitutes one of the basic mayan myths 2 in contrast to this the pre-spanish mayan aristocracy appears to have primarily conceived of maize as male the classic period distinguished two male forms a foliated leafy maize god and a tonsured one 3 the foliated god is present in the so-called maize tree temple of the foliated cross palenque  its cobs being shaped like the deity s head a male maize deity representing the foliated type and labeled god e is present in the three extant maya books of undisputed authenticity whereas the foliated maize god is a one-dimensional vegetation spirit the tonsured maize god s functions are much more diverse when performing ritually the latter typically wears a netted jade skirt and a belt with a large spondylus shell covering the loins on stelae it is a queen rather than a king that tends to represent the tonsured maize god the queen thus appears as a maize goddess in accordance with the mayan narrative traditions mentioned above late pre-classic and classic mayan maize mythology edit fig 2 san francisco capstone depicting the tonsured maize god residing in a well many classic mayan paintings particularly those on vases testify to the existence of a rich mythology centered on the tonsured maize god the late pre-classic murals of san bartolo demonstrate its great antiquity 4 5 several theories with varying degrees of ethnographic support have been formulated to account for episodes such as the maize deity s resurrection from a turtle his canoe voyage and his transformation into a cacao tree popol vuh twin myth extension edit the tonsured maize god is often accompanied by the hero twins following karl taube many scholars such as michael d coe believe that the resurrected tonsured maize god of the classic period corresponds to the father of the hero twins in the popol vuh called hun-hunahpu 3 however this generally accepted identification has also been contested 6 cosmological creation myth edit linda schele s emphasis on creation has led to a series of interconnected hypotheses all involving the cosmological centrality of the tonsured maize god or first father  to wit his establishment of the so-called three-stone hearth assumed to represent a constellation 7 8 his raising of the world tree 7 his dance of creation 7 9 10 and his stance as an acrobat which more or less coinciding with representations of a crocodile tree seems to evoke the central world tree 11 the maize god s presence in the san bartolo arrangement of five world trees has been interpreted as his establishment of the world 12 seasonal myth edit another theory formulated by simon martin 13 focuses on the tonsured maize god s interaction with an aged jaguar deity of trade god l this interaction is related to the hero s transformation into a cacao tree conceived as a trophy tree god l is assumed to have presided over the dry season dedicated to long-distance trade warfare and the cacao harvest and the tonsured maize god over the wet season and the growth of the maize the onset of the two seasons is thought to be symbolized by the defeat of the maize deity and of god l respectively gulf coast maize myth edit in many scenes an aquatic environment strongly comes to the fore see fig 2  most famously in the maize deity s resurrection from the carapace of a turtle that is floating on the waters braakhuis 6 pointed out that such an environment also characterizes an important maize myth shared by many ethnic groups such as huaxtecs totonacs nahuas and zoques inhabiting mexico s gulf coast the fact that this myth focuses on a male rather than a female maize deity while at the same time establishing an intimate connection between the maize god and the turtle is adduced in support of the idea that the classic mayas once formed part of the same narrative tradition more in particular the pre-classic san bartolo mayan maize deity dancing with a turtle drum amidst aquatic deities may have a connection with a zoque popoluca version of the gulf coast maize myth 6 9 14 names and calendar functions edit several designations for the pre-spanish maize god occur in the book of chilam balam of chumayel they include ah mun tender green shoot 15 and zac uac nal white six new corn or uac chuaac nal six tall new corn  2 in the wake of schele the tonsured maize god hypothetically equated with hun-hunahpu has often been nicknamed first father the classic name of the tonsured

a general sense maize relates to the day q an ripe or ripeness  the appearance of the tonsured maize god is connected to the base date of the long count 4 ahau 8 cumku the head of the tonsured maize god serves to denote the number 1, that of the foliated maize god the number 8. 16 the tonsured maize god is sometimes found associated with the lunar crescent and may therefore have played a role in the divisions of the lunar count his head seems to occur in glyph c of the lunar series see also maya moon goddess
