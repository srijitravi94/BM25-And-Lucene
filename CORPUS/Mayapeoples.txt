maya living in this area at the start of the 21st century 1 2 guatemala southern mexico and the yucatán peninsula belize el salvador and western honduras have managed to maintain numerous remnants of their ancient cultural heritage some are quite integrated into the majority hispanicized mestizo cultures of the nations in which they reside while others continue a more traditional culturally

term yucatec maya  but is identified by speakers and yucatecos simply as maya  among maya speakers spanish is commonly spoken as a second or first language there is a significant amount of confusion

the people are also called yucatec maya that term refers only to the language and the correct name for the people is simply maya not mayans  maya is one language in the mayan language family thus to refer to maya as mayans would be similar to referring to spanish people as romantics because they speak a language belonging to the romance language family 5 confusion of the term maya mayan as an ethnic label occurs because maya women who use traditional dress identify by the ethnic term mestiza and not maya 6 persons use a strategy of ethnic identification that juan castillo cocom refers to as ethnoexodus —meaning that ethnic self-identification as maya is quite variable situational and articulated not to processes of producing group identity but of escaping from discriminatory processes of sociocultural marginalization 7 8 the yucatán s indigenous population was first exposed to europeans after a party of spanish shipwreck survivors came ashore in 1511. one of the sailors gonzalo guerrero is reported to have taken up with a local woman and started a family he became a counselor among a local polity near present-day chetumal later spanish expeditions to the region were led by córdoba in 1517, grijalva in 1518, and cortés in 1519. from 1528 to 1540, several attempts by francisco montejo to conquer the yucatán failed his son francisco de montejo the younger fared almost as badly when he first took over while desperately holding out at chichen itza he lost 150 men in a single day 9 european diseases massive recruitment of native warriors from campeche and champoton and internal hatred between the xiu maya and the lords of cocom eventually turned the tide for montejo the younger chichen itza was conquered by 1570. 9 in 1542, the western yucatán peninsula also surrendered to him chichen itza s el castillo historically the population in the eastern half of the peninsula was less affected by and less integrated with hispanic culture than the western half in

small population avoiding contact with outsiders until the late 20th century by living in small groups in the lacandon jungle these lacandon maya came from the campeche petén area north-east of chiapas and moved into the lacandon rain-forest at the end of the 18th century in the course of the 20th century and increasingly in the 1950s and 1960s other people mainly the maya and subsistence peasants from the highlands  also entered into the lacandon region initially encouraged by the government this immigration led to land-related conflicts and an increasing pressure on the rainforest to halt the migration the government decided in 1971 to declare a large part of the forest 614,000 hectares or 6140 km2 a protected area the montes azules biosphere reserve they appointed only one small population group the 66 lacandon families as tenants thus creating the lacandon community  thereby displacing 2000 tzeltal and ch ol families from 26 communities and leaving non-lacandon communities dependent on the government for granting their rights to land in the decades that followed the government carried out numerous programs to keep the problems in the region under control using land distribution as a political tool as a way of ensuring loyalty from different campesino groups this strategy of divide and rule led to great disaffection and tensions among population groups in the region see also the chiapas conflict and the lacandon jungle  belize edit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it january 2012 the maya population in belize is concentrated in the

orthodoxing the western rural areas by christian orthodox missionaries beginning from negligible roots prior to 1960s however protestant pentecostalism has grown to become the predominant religion of guatemala city and other urban centers later to 2010s that almost of all maya of several rural areas of west guatemala living rural areas were mostly mass converted from catholicism or possibly maya religion due of various reasons to either eastern or oriental orthodoxy by late fr andres giron and some other orthodox missionaries and also smaller to mid-sized towns also slowly converted as well

native-born guatemalan writers that wrote in spanish maya cultural heritage tourism edit play media a boy playing maya trumpet opposite of palacio nacional mexico city mexico there is an undeniable symbiotic relationship between cultural heritage tourism and a national identity in the case of the maya the many national identities have been constructed because of the growing demands placed on them by cultural tourism by focusing on lifeways through costumes rituals diet handicrafts language housing or other features the identity of the economy shifts from the sale of labor to that of the sale of culture 30 global tourism is now considered one of the largest scale movement of goods services and people in history and a significant catalyst for economic development and sociopolitical change 31 estimated that between 35 and 40 percent of tourism today is represented by cultural tourism or heritage tourism this alternative to mass tourism offers opportunities for place-based engagement that frames context for interaction by the lived space and everyday life of other peoples as well as sites and objects of global historical significance 32 in this production of tourism the use of historic symbols signs and topics form a new side that characterizes a nation and can play an active role in nation building 33 with this type of tourism people argue that ethno-commerce may open unprecedented opportunities for creating value of various kinds tourists travel with cultural expectations which has created a touristic experience sometimes faced with the need to invent traditions of artificial and contrived attractions often developed at the expense of local tradition and meanings 34 an example of this can be seen in “mayanizing tourism on roatan island honduras archaeological perspectives on heritage development and indignity.” alejandro j figueroa et al. combine archaeological data and ethnographic insights to explore a highly contested tourism economy in their discussion of how places on roatan island honduras have become increasingly “mayanized” over the past decade as tour operators and developers continue to invent an idealized maya past for the island non-maya archaeological remains and cultural patrimony are constantly being threatened and destroyed while heritage tourism provides economic opportunities for some it can devalue contributions made by less familiar groups 35 notable maya people edit see also category maya people ah ahaual a 7th-century captive of noble lineage recorded in pre-columbian maya inscriptions hunac ceel fl c 1300
