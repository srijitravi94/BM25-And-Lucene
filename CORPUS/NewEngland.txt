the colonists the boston tea party was a protest to which britain responded with a series of punitive laws stripping massachusetts of self-government which were termed the intolerable acts by the colonists the confrontation led to the first battles of the american revolutionary war in 1775 and the expulsion of the british authorities from the region in spring 1776. the region also played a prominent role in the movement to abolish slavery in the united states and was the first region of the u.s transformed by the industrial revolution centered on the blackstone and merrimack river valleys the physical geography of new england is diverse for such a small area southeastern new england is covered by a narrow coastal plain while the western and northern regions are dominated by the rolling hills and worn-down peaks of the northern end of the appalachian mountains the atlantic fall line lies close to the coast which enabled numerous cities to take advantage of water power along the numerous rivers such as the connecticut river which bisects the region from north to south each state is principally subdivided into small incorporated municipalities known as towns many of which are governed by town meetings the only unincorporated areas in the region exist in the sparsely populated northern regions of maine new hampshire and vermont the region is one of the u.s census bureau

french and indian wars edit an early english map of new england c 1670, depicts the area around modern portsmouth new hampshire relationships between colonists and local indian tribes alternated between peace and armed skirmishes the bloodiest of which was the pequot war in 1637 which resulted in the mystic massacre 29 on may 19, 1643, the colonies of massachusetts bay plymouth new haven and connecticut joined together in a loose compact called the new england confederation officially the united colonies of new england  the confederation was designed largely to coordinate mutual defense and gained some importance during king philip s war 30 from june 1675 through april 1678, king philip s war pitted the colonists and their indian allies against a widespread indian uprising resulting in killings and massacres on both sides 31 during the next 74 years there were six colonial wars that took place primarily between new england and new france see the french and indian wars as well as father rale s war and father le loutre s war  throughout these wars new england was allied with the iroquois confederacy and new france was allied with the wabanaki confederacy after the new england conquest of acadia in 1710, mainland nova scotia was under the control of new england but both present-day new brunswick and virtually all of present-day maine remained contested territory between new england and new france after the british won the war in 1763, the connecticut river valley was opened for british settlement into western new hampshire and what is today vermont the new england colonies were settled primarily by farmers who became relatively self-sufficient later new england s economy began to focus on crafts and trade aided by the puritan work ethic in contrast to the southern colonies which focused on agricultural production while importing finished goods from england 32 dominion of new england edit main articles dominion of new england american revolutionary war american revolution and boston campaign the new england ensign one of several flags historically associated with new england this flag was reportedly used by colonial merchant ships sailing out of new england ports 1686 – c 1737. 33 34 35 36 37 new england s siege of louisbourg 1745 by peter monamy by 1686, king james ii had become concerned about the increasingly independent ways of the colonies including their self-governing charters their open flouting of the navigation acts and their growing military power he therefore established the dominion of new england an administrative union comprising all of the new england colonies 38 in 1688, the former dutch colonies of new york east new jersey and west new jersey were added to the dominion the union was imposed from the outside and contrary to the rooted democratic tradition of the region and it was highly unpopular among the colonists 39 the dominion significantly modified the charters of the colonies including the appointment of royal governors to nearly all of them there was an uneasy tension between the royal governors their officers and the elected governing bodies of the colonies the governors wanted unlimited authority and the different layers of locally elected officials would often resist them in most cases the local town governments continued operating as self-governing bodies just as they had before the appointment of the governors 40 after the glorious revolution in 1689, bostonians overthrew royal governor sir edmund andros they seized dominion officials and adherents to the church of england during a popular and bloodless uprising 41 these tensions eventually culminated in the american revolution boiling over with the outbreak of the war of american independence in 1775. the first battles of the war were fought in lexington and concord massachusetts later leading to the siege of boston by continental troops in march 1776, british forces were compelled to retreat from boston new england

dissolution of the dominion of new england the colonies of new england ceased to function as a unified political unit but remained a defined cultural region by 1784, all of the states in the region had taken steps towards the abolition of slavery with vermont and massachusetts introducing total abolition in 1777 and 1783, respectively 42 the nickname yankeeland was sometimes used to denote the new england area especially among southerners and british 43 after settling a dispute with new york vermont was admitted to statehood in 1791, formally completing the defined area of new england on march 15, 1820, as part of the missouri compromise the territory of maine formerly a part of massachusetts was admitted to the union as a free state 44 today new england is defined as the six states of connecticut maine massachusetts new hampshire rhode island and vermont 5 for the rest of the period before the american civil war new england remained distinct from the rest of the united states new england s economic growth relied heavily on trade with the british empire 45 and the region s merchants and politicians strongly opposed trade restrictions as the united states and the united kingdom fought the war of 1812, new england federalists organized the hartford convention in the winter of 1814 to discuss the region s grievances concerning the war and to propose changes to the constitution to protect the region s interests and maintain its political power 46 radical delegates within the convention proposed the region s secession from the united states but they were outnumbered by moderates who opposed the idea 47 politically the region often disagreed with the rest of the country 48 massachusetts and connecticut were among the last refuges of the federalist party and new england became the strongest bastion of the new whig party when the second party system began in the 1830s the whigs were usually dominant throughout new england except in the more democratic maine and new hampshire leading statesmen hailed from the region including daniel webster new england was distinct in other ways as well many notable literary and intellectual figures were

george bancroft and william h prescott 49 industrial revolution edit the slater mill historic site in pawtucket rhode island new england was key to the industrial revolution in the united states 50 the blackstone valley running through massachusetts and rhode island has been called the birthplace of america s industrial revolution 51 in 1787, the first cotton mill in america was founded in the north shore seaport of beverly massachusetts as the beverly cotton manufactory 52 the manufactory was also considered the largest cotton mill of its time technological developments and achievements from the manufactory led to the development of more advanced cotton mills including slater mill in pawtucket rhode island towns such as lawrence massachusetts lowell massachusetts woonsocket rhode island and lewiston maine became centers of the textile industry following the innovations at slater mill and the beverly cotton manufactory citation needed the connecticut river valley became a crucible for industrial innovation particularly the springfield armory pioneering such advances as interchangeable parts and the assembly line which influenced manufacturing processes all around the world 53 from early in the nineteenth century until the mid-twentieth the region surrounding springfield massachusetts and hartford connecticut served as the united states epicenter for advanced manufacturing drawing skilled workers from all over the world 54 55 the rapid growth of textile manufacturing in new england between 1815 and 1860 caused a shortage of workers recruiters were hired by mill agents to bring young women and children from the countryside to work in the factories between 1830 and 1860, thousands of farm girls moved from rural areas where there was no paid employment to work in the nearby mills such as the famous lowell mill girls as the textile industry grew immigration also grew by the 1850s immigrants began working in the mills especially irish and french canadians 56 new england as a whole was the most industrialized part of the u.s by 1850, the region accounted for well over a quarter of all manufacturing value in the country and over a third of its industrial workforce 57 it was also the most literate and most educated region in the country 57 anti-slavery edit during the same period new england and areas settled by new englanders upstate new york ohio s western reserve and the upper midwestern states of michigan and wisconsin were the center of the strongest abolitionist and anti-slavery movements in the united states coinciding with the protestant great awakening in the region 58 abolitionists who demanded immediate emancipation such as william lloyd garrison john greenleaf whittier and wendell phillips had their base in the region so too did anti-slavery politicians who wanted to limit the growth of slavery such as john quincy adams charles sumner and john p hale when the anti-slavery republican party was formed in the 1850s all of new england including areas that had previously been strongholds for both the whig and the democratic parties became strongly republican new england remained solidly republican until catholics began to mobilize behind the democrats especially in 1928, and up until the republican party realigned its politics in a shift known as the southern strategy this led to the end of yankee republicanism and began new england s relatively swift transition into a consistently democratic stronghold 59 20th century and beyond edit autumn in new england watercolor maurice prendergast c 1910–1913 the flow of immigrants continued at a steady pace from the 1840s until cut off by world war i the largest numbers came from ireland and britain before 1890, and after that from quebec italy and southern europe the immigrants filled the ranks of factory workers craftsmen and unskilled laborers the irish assumed a larger and larger role in the democratic parts in the cities and statewide while the rural areas remained republican yankees left the farms which never were highly productive many headed west while others became professionals and businessmen in the new england cities great depression edit the great depression in the united states of the 1930s hit the region hard with high unemployment in the industrial cities the democrats appealed to factory workers and especially catholics pulling them into the new deal coalition and making the once-republican region into one that was closely divided however the enormous spending on munitions ships electronics and uniforms during world war ii caused a burst of prosperity in every sector deindustrialization edit fall foliage in the town of stowe vermont the region lost most of its factories starting with the loss of textiles in the 1930s and getting worse after 1960. the new england economy was radically transformed after world war ii the factory economy practically disappeared like urban centers in the rust belt once-bustling new england communities fell into economic decay following the flight of the region s industrial base the textile mills one by one went out of business from the 1920s to the 1970s for example the crompton company after 178 years in business went bankrupt in 1984, costing the jobs of 2,450 workers in five states the major reasons were cheap imports the strong dollar declining exports and a failure to diversify 60 shoes followed alexander king house in suffield connecticut what remains is very high technology manufacturing such as jet engines nuclear submarines pharmaceuticals robotics scientific instruments and medical devices mit the massachusetts institute of technology invented the format for university-industry relations in high tech fields and spawned many software and hardware firms some of which grew rapidly 61 by the 21st century the region had become famous for its leadership roles in the fields of education medicine and medical research high-technology finance and tourism 62 some industrial areas were slow in adjusting to the new service economy in 2000, new england had two of the ten poorest cities by percentage living below the poverty line in the u.s the state capitals of providence rhode island and hartford connecticut 63 they were no longer in the bottom ten by 2010 connecticut massachusetts and new hampshire remain among
