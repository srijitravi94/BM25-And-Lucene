administration of municipal affairs the faulkner act originally enacted in 1950 and substantially amended in 1981, offers four basic plans mayor-council council-manager small municipality and mayor-council-administrator the act provides many choices for communities with a preference for a strong executive and professional management of municipal affairs and offers great flexibility in allowing municipalities to select the characteristics of its government the number of seats on the council seats selected at-large by wards or through a combination of both staggered or concurrent
