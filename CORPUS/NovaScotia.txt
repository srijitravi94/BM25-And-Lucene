more southern colonies in their defiance of britain and rebellion flared at the battle of fort cumberland 1776 and at the siege of saint john 1777  throughout the war american privateers devastated the maritime economy by capturing ships and looting almost every community outside of halifax these american raids alienated many sympathetic or neutral nova scotians into supporting the british by

british settlements in north america and infused nova scotia with additional capital and skills however the migration also caused political tensions between loyalist leaders and the leaders of the existing new england planters settlement the loyalist influx also pushed nova scotia s mi kmaq people to the margins as loyalist land grants encroached on ill-defined native lands as part of the loyalist migration about 3,000 black loyalists arrived they founded the largest free black settlement in north america at birchtown near shelburne however unfair treatment and harsh conditions caused

driven by the ready availability of natural resources especially the fish stocks off the scotian shelf the fishery was a pillar of the economy since its development as part of new france in the 17th century however the fishery suffered a sharp decline due to overfishing in the late 20th century the collapse of the cod stocks and the closure of this sector resulted in a loss of approximately 20,000 jobs in 1992. 42 other sectors in the province were also hit hard particularly during the last two decades coal mining in cape breton and northern mainland nova scotia has virtually ceased production and a large steel mill in sydney closed during the 1990s more recently the high value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar has hurt the forestry industry leading to the shut down of a long-running pulp and paper mill near liverpool mining especially of gypsum and salt and to a lesser extent silica peat and barite is also a significant sector 43 since 1991, offshore oil
