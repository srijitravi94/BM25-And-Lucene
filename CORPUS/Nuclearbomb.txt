category v t e a nuclear weapon is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions either fission fission bomb or from a combination of fission and fusion reactions thermonuclear bomb  both bomb types release large quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter the first test of a fission atomic bomb released an amount of energy approximately equal to 20,000 tons of tnt 84 tj  the first thermonuclear hydrogen bomb test released energy approximately equal to 10 million tons of tnt 42 pj  1 a thermonuclear weapon weighing little more than 2,400 pounds 1,100 kg can release energy equal to more than 1.2 million tons of tnt 5.0 pj  2 a nuclear device no larger than traditional bombs can devastate an entire city by blast fire and radiation since they are weapons of mass destruction the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a focus of international relations policy nuclear weapons have been used twice in war both times by the united states against japan near the end of world war ii on august 6, 1945, the u.s army air forces detonated a uranium gun-type fission bomb nicknamed little boy over the japanese city of hiroshima three days later on august 9, the u.s army air forces detonated a plutonium implosion-type fission bomb nicknamed fat man over the japanese city of nagasaki these bombings resulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 civilians and military personnel from injuries sustained from the explosions 3 the ethics of these bombings and their role in japan s surrender are subjects of debate since the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki nuclear weapons have been detonated over two thousand times for testing and demonstration only a few nations possess such weapons or are suspected of seeking them the only countries known to have detonated nuclear weapons—and acknowledge possessing them—are chronologically by date of first test the united states the soviet union succeeded as a nuclear power by russia  the united kingdom france china india pakistan and north korea israel is believed to possess nuclear weapons though in a policy of deliberate ambiguity it does not acknowledge having them germany italy turkey belgium and the netherlands are nuclear weapons sharing states 4 5 6 south africa is the only country to have independently developed and then renounced and dismantled its nuclear weapons 7 the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons aims to reduce the spread of nuclear weapons but its effectiveness has been questioned and political tensions remained high in the 1970s and 1980s modernisation of weapons continues to this day 8 types main article nuclear weapon design there are two basic types of nuclear weapons those that derive the majority of their energy from nuclear fission reactions alone and those that use fission reactions to begin nuclear fusion reactions that produce a large amount of the total energy output 9 fission weapons the two basic fission weapon designs all existing nuclear weapons derive some of their explosive energy from nuclear fission reactions weapons whose explosive output is exclusively from fission reactions are commonly referred to as atomic bombs or atom bombs abbreviated as a-bombs  this has long been noted as something of a misnomer as their energy comes from the nucleus of the atom just as it does with fusion weapons in fission weapons a mass of fissile material enriched uranium or plutonium is forced into supercriticality—allowing an exponential growth of nuclear chain reactions—either by shooting one piece of sub-critical material into another the gun method or by compressing using explosive lenses a sub-critical sphere of material using chemical explosives to many times its original density the implosion method  the latter approach is considered more sophisticated than the former and only the latter approach can be used if the fissile material is plutonium 10 a major challenge in all nuclear weapon designs is to ensure that a significant fraction of the fuel is consumed before the weapon destroys itself the amount of energy released by fission bombs can range from the equivalent of just under a ton to upwards of 500,000 tons 500 kilotons of tnt 4.2 to 2.1×108 gj  11 all fission reactions generate fission products the remains of the split atomic nuclei many fission products are either highly radioactive but short-lived or moderately radioactive but long-lived  and as such they are a serious form of radioactive contamination if not fully contained fission products are the principal radioactive component of nuclear fallout the most commonly used fissile materials for nuclear weapons applications have been uranium-235 and plutonium-239 less commonly used has been uranium-233 neptunium-237 and some isotopes of americium may be usable for nuclear explosives as well but it is not clear that this has ever been implemented and their plausible use in nuclear weapons is a matter of dispute 12 fusion weapons main article thermonuclear weapon the basics of the teller–ulam design for a hydrogen bomb a fission bomb uses radiation to compress and heat a separate section of fusion fuel the other basic type of nuclear weapon produces a large proportion of its energy in nuclear fusion reactions such fusion weapons are generally referred to as thermonuclear weapons or more colloquially as hydrogen bombs abbreviated as h-bombs  as they rely on fusion reactions between isotopes of hydrogen deuterium and tritium  all such weapons derive a significant portion of their energy from fission reactions used to trigger fusion reactions and fusion reactions can themselves trigger additional fission reactions 13 only six countries—united states russia united kingdom china france and india—have conducted thermonuclear weapon tests whether india has detonated a true multi-staged thermonuclear weapon is controversial 14 north korea claims to have tested a fusion weapon as of january 2016, though this claim is disputed 15 thermonuclear weapons are considered much more difficult to successfully design and execute than primitive fission weapons almost all of the nuclear weapons deployed today use the thermonuclear design because it is more efficient citation needed thermonuclear bombs work by using the energy of a fission bomb to compress and heat fusion fuel in the teller-ulam design which accounts for all multi-megaton yield hydrogen bombs this is accomplished by placing a fission bomb and fusion fuel tritium deuterium or lithium deuteride in proximity within a special radiation-reflecting container when the fission bomb is detonated gamma rays and x-rays emitted first compress the fusion fuel then heat it to thermonuclear temperatures the ensuing fusion reaction creates enormous numbers of high-speed neutrons which can then induce fission in materials not normally prone to it such as depleted uranium each of these components is known as a stage  with the fission bomb as the primary and the fusion capsule as the secondary  in large megaton-range hydrogen bombs about half of the yield comes from the final fissioning of depleted uranium 11 virtually all thermonuclear weapons deployed today use the two-stage design described above but it is possible to add additional fusion stages—each stage igniting a larger amount of fusion fuel in the next stage this technique can be used to construct thermonuclear weapons of arbitrarily large yield in contrast to fission bombs which are limited in their explosive force the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated the tsar bomba of the ussr which released an energy equivalent of over 50 megatons of tnt 210 pj  was a three-stage weapon most thermonuclear weapons are considerably smaller than this due to practical constraints from missile warhead space and weight requirements 16 edward teller often referred to as the father of the hydrogen bomb fusion reactions do not create fission products and thus contribute far less to the creation of nuclear fallout than fission reactions but because all thermonuclear weapons contain at least one fission stage and many high-yield thermonuclear devices have a final fission stage thermonuclear weapons can generate at least as much nuclear fallout as fission-only weapons other types main articles boosted fission weapon neutron bomb radiological weapon and antimatter weapon there are other types of nuclear weapons as well for example a boosted fission weapon is a fission bomb that increases its explosive yield through a small amount of fusion reactions but it is not a fusion bomb in the boosted bomb the neutrons produced by the fusion reactions serve primarily to increase the efficiency of the fission bomb there are two types of boosted fission bomb internally boosted in which a deuterium-tritium mixture is injected into the bomb core and externally boosted in which concentric shells of lithium-deuteride and depleted uranium are layered on the outside of the fission bomb core some nuclear weapons are designed for special purposes a neutron bomb is a thermonuclear weapon that yields a relatively small explosion but a relatively large amount of neutron radiation such a device could theoretically be used to cause massive casualties while leaving infrastructure mostly intact and creating a minimal amount of fallout the detonation of any nuclear weapon is accompanied by a blast of neutron radiation surrounding a nuclear weapon with suitable materials such as cobalt or gold creates a weapon known as a salted bomb this device can produce exceptionally large quantities of long-lived radioactive contamination it has been conjectured that such a device could serve as a doomsday weapon because such a large quantity of radioactivities with half-lives of decades lifted into the stratosphere where winds would distribute it around the globe would make all life on the planet extinct in connection with the strategic defense initiative research into the nuclear pumped laser was conducted under the dod program project excalibur but this did not result in a working weapon the concept involves the tapping of the energy of an exploding nuclear bomb to power a single-shot laser which is directed at a distant target during the starfish prime high-altitude nuclear test in 1962, an unexpected effect was produced which is called a nuclear electromagnetic pulse this is an intense flash of electromagnetic energy produced by a rain of high energy electrons which in turn are produced by a nuclear bomb s gamma rays this flash of energy can permanently destroy or disrupt electronic equipment if insufficiently shielded it has been proposed to use this effect to disable an enemy s military and civilian infrastructure as an adjunct to other nuclear or conventional military operations against that enemy because the effect is produced by high altitude nuclear detonations it can produce damage to electronics over a wide even continental geographical area research has been done into the possibility of pure fusion bombs nuclear weapons that consist of fusion reactions without requiring a fission bomb to initiate them such a device might provide a simpler path to thermonuclear weapons than one that required development of fission weapons first and pure fusion weapons would create significantly less nuclear fallout than other thermonuclear weapons because they would not disperse fission products in 1998, the united states department of energy divulged that the united states had ..made a substantial investment in the past to develop pure fusion weapons but that the u.s does not have and is not developing a pure fusion weapon  and that no credible design for a pure fusion weapon resulted from the doe investment  17 antimatter which consists of particles resembling ordinary matter particles in most of their properties but having opposite electric charge has been considered as a trigger mechanism for nuclear weapons 18 19 20 a major obstacle is the difficulty of producing antimatter in large enough quantities and there is no evidence that it is feasible beyond the military domain 21 however the u.s air force funded studies of the physics of antimatter in the cold war and began considering its possible use in weapons not just as a trigger but as the explosive itself 22 a fourth generation nuclear weapon design 18 is related to and relies upon the same principle as antimatter-catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion 23 most variation in nuclear weapon design is for the purpose of achieving different yields for different situations and in manipulating design elements to attempt to minimize weapon size 11 weapons delivery see also nuclear weapons delivery nuclear triad strategic bomber intercontinental ballistic missile and submarine-launched ballistic missile the first nuclear weapons were gravity bombs such as this fat man weapon dropped on nagasaki japan they were large and could only be delivered by heavy bomber aircraft a demilitarized commercial launch of the russian strategic rocket forces r-36 icbm also known by the nato reporting name ss-18 satan upon its first fielding in the late 1960s the ss-18 remains the single highest throw weight missile delivery system ever built the system used to deliver a nuclear weapon to its target is an important factor affecting both nuclear weapon design and nuclear strategy the design development and maintenance of delivery systems are among the most expensive parts of a nuclear weapons program they account for example for 57 of the financial resources spent by the united states on nuclear weapons projects since 1940. 24 the simplest method for delivering a nuclear weapon is a gravity bomb dropped from aircraft this was the method used by the united states against japan this method places few restrictions on the size of the weapon it does however limit attack range response time to an impending attack and the number of weapons that a country can field at the same time with miniaturization nuclear bombs can be delivered by both strategic bombers and tactical fighter-bombers this method is the primary means of nuclear weapons delivery the majority of u.s nuclear warheads for example are free-fall gravity bombs namely the b61 11 needs update montage of an inert test of a united states trident slbm submarine launched ballistic missile  from submerged to the terminal or re-entry phase of the multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles more preferable from a strategic point of view is a nuclear weapon mounted on a missile which can use a ballistic trajectory to deliver the warhead over the horizon although even short-range missiles allow for a faster and less vulnerable attack the development of long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms and submarine-launched ballistic missiles slbms has given some nations the ability to plausibly deliver missiles anywhere on the globe with a high likelihood of success more advanced systems such as multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles mirvs  can launch multiple warheads at different targets from one missile reducing the chance of a successful missile defense today missiles are most common among systems designed for delivery of nuclear weapons making a warhead small enough to fit onto a missile though can be difficult 11 tactical weapons have involved the most variety of delivery types including not only gravity bombs and missiles but also artillery shells land mines and nuclear depth charges and torpedoes for anti-submarine warfare an atomic mortar has been tested by the united states small two-man portable tactical weapons somewhat misleadingly referred to as suitcase bombs  such as the special atomic demolition munition have been developed although the difficulty of combining sufficient yield with portability limits their military utility 11 nuclear strategy main articles nuclear strategy and deterrence theory see also nuclear peace essentials of post–cold war deterrence single integrated operational plan nuclear warfare and on thermonuclear war nuclear warfare strategy is a set of policies that deal with preventing or fighting a nuclear war the policy of trying to prevent an attack by a nuclear weapon from another country by threatening nuclear retaliation is known as the strategy of nuclear deterrence the goal in deterrence is to always maintain a second strike capability the ability of a country to respond to a nuclear attack with one of its own and potentially to strive for first strike status the ability to destroy an enemy s nuclear forces before they could retaliate  during the cold war policy and military theorists considered the sorts of policies that might prevent a nuclear attack and they developed game theory models that could lead to stable deterrence conditions 25 the now decommissioned united states peacekeeper missile was an icbm developed to replace the minuteman missile in the late 1980s each missile like the heavier lift russian ss-18 satan could contain up to ten nuclear warheads shown in red  each of which could be aimed at a different target a factor in the development of mirvs was to make complete missile defense difficult for an enemy country different forms of nuclear weapons delivery see above allow for different types of nuclear strategies the goals of any strategy are generally to make it difficult for an enemy to launch a pre-emptive strike against the weapon system and difficult to defend against the delivery of the weapon during a potential conflict this can mean keeping weapon locations hidden such as deploying them on submarines or land mobile transporter erector launchers whose locations are difficult to track or it can mean protecting weapons by burying them in hardened missile silo bunkers other components of nuclear strategies included using missile defenses to destroy the missiles before they land or implementing civil defense measures using early-warning systems to evacuate citizens to safe areas before an attack weapons designed to threaten large populations or to deter attacks are known as strategic weapons nuclear weapons for use on a battlefield in military situations are called tactical weapons critics of nuclear war strategy often suggest that a nuclear war between two nations would result in mutual annihilation from this point of view the significance of nuclear weapons is to deter war because any nuclear war would escalate out of mutual distrust and fear resulting in mutually assured destruction this threat of national if not global destruction has been a strong motivation for anti-nuclear weapons activism critics from the peace movement and within the military establishment citation needed have questioned the usefulness of such weapons in the current military climate according to an advisory opinion issued by the international court of justice in 1996, the use of or threat of use of such weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict but the court did not reach an opinion as to whether or not the threat or use would be lawful in specific extreme circumstances such as if the survival of the state were at stake another deterrence position is that nuclear proliferation can be desirable in this case it is argued that unlike conventional weapons nuclear weapons deter all-out war between states and they succeeded in doing this during the cold war between the u.s and the soviet union 26 in the late 1950s and early 1960s gen pierre marie gallois of france an adviser to charles de gaulle argued in books like the balance of terror strategy for the nuclear age 1961 that mere possession of a nuclear arsenal was enough to ensure deterrence and thus concluded that the spread of nuclear weapons could increase international stability some prominent neo-realist scholars such as kenneth waltz and john mearsheimer have argued along the lines of gallois that some forms of nuclear proliferation would decrease the likelihood of total war especially in troubled regions of the world where there exists a single nuclear-weapon state aside from the public opinion that opposes proliferation in any form there are two schools of thought on the matter those like mearsheimer who favored selective proliferation 27 and waltz who was somewhat more non-interventionist 28 29 interest in proliferation and the stability-instability paradox that it generates continues to this day with ongoing debate about indigenous japanese and south korean nuclear deterrent against north korea 30 the threat of potentially suicidal terrorists possessing nuclear weapons a form of nuclear terrorism complicates the decision process the prospect of mutually assured destruction might not deter an enemy who expects to die in the confrontation further if the initial act is from a stateless terrorist instead of a sovereign nation there might not be a nation or specific target to retaliate against it has been argued especially after the september 11, 2001 attacks that this complication calls for a new nuclear strategy one that is distinct from that which gave relative stability during the cold war 31 since 1996, the united states has had a policy of allowing the targeting of its nuclear weapons at terrorists armed with weapons of mass destruction 32 robert gallucci argues that although traditional deterrence is not an effective approach toward terrorist groups bent on causing a nuclear catastrophe gallucci believes that the united states should instead consider a policy of expanded deterrence which focuses not solely on the would-be nuclear terrorists but on those states that may deliberately transfer or inadvertently lead nuclear weapons and materials to them by threatening retaliation against those states the united states may be able to deter that which it cannot physically prevent  33 graham allison makes a similar case arguing that the key to expanded deterrence is coming up with ways of tracing nuclear material to the country that forged the fissile material after a nuclear bomb detonates nuclear forensics cops would collect debris samples and send them to a laboratory for radiological analysis by identifying unique attributes of the fissile material including its impurities and contaminants one could trace the path back to its origin 34 the process is analogous to identifying a criminal by fingerprints the goal would be twofold first to deter leaders of nuclear states from selling weapons to terrorists by holding them accountable for any use of their weapons second to give leaders every incentive to tightly secure their nuclear weapons and materials 34 governance control and law main articles treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons strategic arms limitation talks intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty start i start ii strategic offensive reductions treaty comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty lahore summit and new start see also prevention of nuclear catastrophe the international atomic energy agency was created in 1957 to encourage peaceful development of nuclear technology while providing international safeguards against nuclear proliferation because they are weapons of mass destruction the proliferation and possible use of nuclear weapons are important issues in international relations and diplomacy in most countries the use of nuclear force can only be authorized by the head of government or head of state 35 despite controls and regulations governing nuclear weapons there is an inherent danger of accidents mistakes false alarms blackmail theft and sabotage  36 in the late 1940s lack of mutual trust prevented the united states and the soviet union from making progress on arms control agreements the russell–einstein manifesto was issued in london on july 9, 1955, by bertrand russell in the midst of the cold war it highlighted the dangers posed by nuclear weapons and called for world leaders to seek peaceful resolutions to international conflict the signatories included eleven pre-eminent intellectuals and scientists including albert einstein who signed it just days before his death on april 18, 1955. a few days after the release philanthropist cyrus s eaton offered to sponsor a conference—called for in the manifesto—in pugwash nova scotia eaton s birthplace this conference was to be the first of the pugwash conferences on science and world affairs held in july 1957. by the 1960s steps were taken to limit both the proliferation of nuclear weapons to other countries and the environmental effects of nuclear testing the partial nuclear test ban treaty 1963 restricted all nuclear testing to underground nuclear testing to prevent contamination from nuclear fallout whereas the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons 1968 attempted to place restrictions on the types of activities signatories could participate in with the goal of allowing the transference of non-military nuclear technology to member countries without fear of proliferation in 1957, the international atomic energy agency iaea was established under the mandate of the united nations to encourage development of peaceful applications of nuclear technology provide international safeguards against its misuse and facilitate the application of safety measures in its use in 1996, many nations signed the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty 37 which prohibits all testing of nuclear weapons a testing ban imposes a significant hindrance to nuclear arms development by any complying country 38 the treaty requires the ratification by 44 specific states before it can go into force as of 2012, the ratification of eight of these states is still required 37 additional treaties and agreements have governed nuclear weapons stockpiles between the countries with the two largest stockpiles the united states and the soviet union and later between the united states and russia these include treaties such as salt ii never ratified  start i expired  inf, start ii never ratified  sort and new start as well as non-binding agreements such as salt i and the presidential nuclear initiatives 39 of 1991. even when they did not enter into force these agreements helped limit and later reduce the numbers and types of nuclear weapons between the united states and the soviet union russia nuclear weapons have also been opposed by agreements between countries many nations have been declared nuclear-weapon-free zones areas where nuclear weapons production and deployment are prohibited through the use of treaties the treaty of tlatelolco 1967 prohibited any production or deployment of nuclear weapons in latin america and the caribbean and the treaty of pelindaba 1964 prohibits nuclear weapons in many african countries as recently as 2006 a central asian nuclear weapon free zone was established amongst the former soviet republics of central asia prohibiting nuclear weapons in 1996, the international court of justice the highest court of the united nations issued an advisory opinion concerned with the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons  the court ruled that the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons would violate various articles of international law including the geneva conventions the hague conventions the un charter and the universal declaration of human rights given the unique destructive characteristics of nuclear weapons the international committee of the red cross calls on states to ensure that these weapons are never used irrespective of whether they consider them lawful or not 40 additionally there have been other specific actions meant to discourage countries from developing nuclear arms in the wake of the tests by india and pakistan in 1998, economic sanctions were temporarily levied against both countries though neither were signatories with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty one of the stated casus belli for the initiation of the 2003 iraq war was an accusation by the united states that iraq was actively pursuing nuclear arms though this was soon discovered not to be the case as the program had been discontinued  in 1981, israel had bombed a nuclear reactor being constructed in osirak iraq in what it called an attempt to halt iraq s previous nuclear arms ambitions in 2007, israel bombed another reactor being constructed in syria in 2013, mark diesendorf said that governments of france india north korea pakistan uk and south africa have used nuclear power and or research reactors to assist nuclear weapons development or to contribute to their supplies of nuclear explosives from military reactors 41 disarmament main article nuclear disarmament for statistics on possession and deployment see list of states with nuclear weapons the ussr and united states nuclear weapon stockpiles throughout the cold war until 2015, with a precipitous drop in total numbers following the end of the cold war in 1991. nuclear disarmament refers to both the act of reducing or eliminating nuclear weapons and to the end state of a nuclear-free world in which nuclear weapons are eliminated beginning with the 1963 partial test ban treaty and continuing through the 1996 comprehensive test ban treaty there have been many treaties to limit or reduce nuclear weapons testing and stockpiles the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty has as one of its explicit conditions that all signatories must pursue negotiations in good faith towards the long-term goal of complete disarmament  the nuclear weapon states have largely treated that aspect of the agreement as decorative and without force 42 only one country—south africa—has ever fully renounced nuclear weapons they had independently developed the former soviet republics of belarus kazakhstan and ukraine returned soviet nuclear arms stationed in their countries to russia after the collapse of the ussr proponents of nuclear disarmament say that it would lessen the probability of nuclear war especially accidentally critics of nuclear disarmament say that it would undermine the present nuclear peace and deterrence and would lead to increased global instability various american elder statesmen 43 who were in office during the cold war period have been advocating the elimination of nuclear weapons these officials include henry kissinger george shultz sam nunn and william perry in january 2010, lawrence m krauss stated that no issue carries more importance to the long-term health and security of humanity than the effort to reduce and perhaps one day rid the world of nuclear weapons  44 ukrainian workers use equipment provided by the u.s defense threat reduction agency to dismantle a soviet-era missile silo after the end of the cold war ukraine and the other non-russian post-soviet republics relinquished soviet nuclear stockpiles to russia in the years after the end of the cold war there have been numerous campaigns to urge the abolition of nuclear weapons such as that organized by the global zero movement and the goal of a world without nuclear weapons was advocated by united states president barack obama in an april 2009 speech in prague 45 a cnn poll from april 2010 indicated that the american public was nearly evenly split on the issue 46 some analysts have argued that nuclear weapons have made the world relatively safer with peace through deterrence and through the stability–instability paradox including in south asia 47 48 kenneth waltz has argued that nuclear weapons have helped keep an uneasy peace and further nuclear weapon proliferation might even help avoid the large scale conventional wars that were so common before their invention at the end of world war ii 29 but former secretary henry kissinger says there is a new danger which cannot be addressed by deterrence the classical notion of deterrence was that there was some consequences before which aggressors and evildoers would recoil in a world of suicide bombers that calculation doesn’t operate in any comparable way  49 george shultz has said if you think of the people who are doing suicide attacks and people like that get a nuclear weapon they are almost by definition not deterrable  50 united nations main article united nations office for disarmament affairs the un office for disarmament affairs unoda is a department of the united nations secretariat established in january 1998 as part of the united nations secretary-general kofi annan s plan to reform the un as presented in his report to the general assembly in july 1997. 51 its goal is to promote nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and the strengthening of the disarmament regimes in respect to other weapons of mass destruction chemical and biological weapons it also promotes

cabin fire forced the crew to abandon the aircraft six crew members ejected safely but one who did not have an ejection seat was killed while trying to bail out the bomber crashed onto sea ice in greenland causing the nuclear payload to rupture and disperse which resulted in widespread radioactive contamination september 18–19 1980 the damascus accident occurred in damascus arkansas where a

world from 1945 to 1980. radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing was first drawn to public attention in 1954 when the castle bravo hydrogen bomb test at the pacific proving grounds contaminated the crew and catch of the japanese fishing boat lucky dragon 65 one of the fishermen died in japan seven months later and the fear of contaminated tuna led to a temporary boycotting of the popular staple in japan the incident caused widespread concern around the world especially regarding the effects of nuclear fallout and atmospheric nuclear testing and provided a decisive impetus for the emergence of the anti-nuclear weapons movement in many countries  65 as public awareness and concern mounted over the possible health hazards associated with exposure to the nuclear fallout various studies were done to assess the extent of the hazard a centers for disease control and prevention national cancer institute study claims that fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests would lead to perhaps 11,000 excess deaths amongst people alive during atmospheric testing in the united states from all forms of cancer including leukemia from 1951 to well into the 21st century 66 67 as of march 2009, the u.s is the only nation that compensates nuclear test victims since the radiation exposure compensation act of 1990, more than 1.38 billion in compensation has been approved the money

effects and 10 due to super-lethal radiation exposure intermediate stage—from 10–12 weeks the deaths in this period are from ionizing radiation in the median lethal range – ld50 late period—lasting from 13–20 weeks this period has some improvement in survivors condition delayed period—from 20 weeks characterized by numerous complications mostly related to healing of thermal and mechanical injuries and if the individual was exposed to a few hundred to a thousand millisieverts of radiation it is coupled with infertility sub-fertility and blood disorders furthermore ionizing radiation above a dose of around 50–100 millisievert exposure has been shown to statistically begin increasing one s chance of dying of cancer sometime in their lifetime over the normal unexposed rate of 25  in the long term a heightened rate of cancer proportional to the dose received would begin to be observed after 5 years with lesser problems such as eye cataracts and other more minor effects in other organs and tissue also being observed over the long term fallout exposure – depending on if further afield individuals shelter in place or evacuate perpendicular to the direction of the wind and therefore avoid contact with the fallout plume and stay there for the days and weeks after the nuclear explosion their exposure to fallout and therefore their total dose will vary with those who do shelter in place and or evacuate experiencing a total dose that would be negligible in comparison to someone who just went about their life as normal 76 77 staying indoors until after the most hazardous fallout isotope i-131 decays away to 0.1 of its initial quantity after ten half lifes – which is represented by 80 days in i-131s case would make the difference between likely contracting thyroid cancer or escaping completely from this substance depending on the actions of the individual 78 public opposition see also history of the anti-nuclear movement and international day against nuclear tests women strike for peace during the cuban missile crisis demonstration against nuclear testing in lyon france in the 1980s peace movements emerged in japan and in 1954 they converged to form a unified japanese council against atomic and hydrogen bombs  japanese opposition to nuclear weapons tests in the pacific ocean was widespread and an estimated 35 million signatures were collected on petitions calling for bans on nuclear weapons  79 in the united kingdom the first aldermaston march organised by the campaign for nuclear disarmament cnd took place at easter 1958, when according to the cnd several thousand people marched for four days from trafalgar square london to the atomic weapons research establishment close to aldermaston in berkshire england to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons 80 81 the aldermaston marches continued into the late 1960s when tens of thousands of people took part in the four-day marches 79 in 1959, a letter in the bulletin of atomic scientists was the start of a successful campaign to stop the atomic energy commission dumping radioactive waste quantify in the sea 19 kilometres from boston 82 in 1962, linus pauling won the nobel peace prize for his work to stop the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons and the ban the bomb movement spread 52 in 1963, many countries ratified the partial test ban treaty prohibiting atmospheric nuclear testing radioactive fallout became less of an issue and the anti-nuclear weapons movement went into decline for some years 65 83 a resurgence of interest occurred amid european and american fears of nuclear war in the 1980s 84 costs and technology spin-offs see also global positioning system nuclear weapons delivery history of computing hardware eniac and swords to ploughshares according to an audit by the brookings institution between 1940 and 1996, the u.s spent 8.89 trillion in present-day terms 85 on nuclear weapons programs 57 percent of which was spent on building nuclear weapons delivery systems 6.3 percent of the total 557 billion in present-day terms was spent on environmental remediation and nuclear waste management for example cleaning up the hanford site and 7 percent of the total 625 billion was spent on making nuclear weapons themselves 86 non-weapons uses main article peaceful nuclear explosion peaceful nuclear explosions are nuclear explosions conducted for non-military purposes such as activities related to economic development including the creation of canals during the 1960s and 70s both the united states and the soviet union conducted a number of pnes six of the explosions by the soviet union are considered to have been of an applied nature not just tests subsequently the united states and the soviet union halted their programs definitions and limits are covered in the peaceful nuclear explosions treaty of 1976. 87 88 the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty of 1996, once it enters into force will prohibit all nuclear
