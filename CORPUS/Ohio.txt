states ohio is the 34th largest by area the 7th most populous and the 10th most densely populated of the 50 united states the state s capital and largest city is columbus the state takes its name from the ohio river the name originated from the iroquois language word ohi-yo meaning great river or large creek  21 22 23 partitioned from the northwest territory the state was admitted to the union as the 17th state and the first under the northwest ordinance on march 1, 1803. 10 24 ohio is historically known as the buckeye state after its ohio buckeye trees and ohioans are also known as buckeyes  2 the government of ohio is composed of the executive branch led by the governor the legislative branch which comprises the ohio general assembly and the judicial branch which is led by the state supreme court ohio occupies 16 seats in the united states house of representatives 25 ohio is known for its status as both a swing state 26 and a bellwether 26 in national elections six presidents of the united states have been elected who had ohio as their home state etymology ohio derives from the iroquois language as their name for the ohio river alleghany river ohi yo this is pronounced oh-hee-yoh with the i sound being held an extra second folk etymology claims that this translates as beautiful river however it appears that the word can be broken down as o- pronoun prefix translates as it implies that whatever is about to follow it is considered a permanent condition of the item  hih verb to spill gihedenyo noun creek stream  27 that being said the most sensible translation ought to be continuously-spilling creek or continuously-giving creek the word for creek is used instead of river since it still flows into a larger river the mississippi the common accent of ohio shifts regularly so there are multiple different accepted ways of saying ohio that have been common throughout the last century such as oh-hai-yuh uh-hai-yoh uh-hai-yuh the most recent shift that is beginning to surface sounds something along the lines of wh-hai-yuh geography further information list of ohio counties list of cities in ohio list of villages in ohio list of ohio townships ohio

north america s manufacturing capacity 28 to the north lake erie gives ohio 312 miles 502 km of coastline 29 which allows for numerous cargo ports ohio s southern border is defined by the ohio river with the border being at the 1792 low-water mark on the north side of the river  30 and much of the northern border is defined by lake erie ohio s neighbors are pennsylvania to the east michigan to the northwest lake erie to the north indiana to the west kentucky on the south and west virginia on the southeast ohio s borders were defined by metes and bounds in the enabling act of 1802 as follows bounded on the east by the pennsylvania line on the south by the ohio river to the mouth of the great miami river on the west by the line drawn due north from the mouth of the great miami aforesaid and on the north by an east and west line drawn through the southerly extreme of lake michigan running east after intersecting the due north line aforesaid from the mouth of the great miami until it shall intersect lake erie or the territorial line and thence with the same through lake erie to the pennsylvania line aforesaid the ohio coast of lake erie ohio is bounded by the ohio river but nearly all of the river itself belongs to kentucky and west virginia in 1980, the u.s supreme court held that based on the wording of the cessation of territory by virginia which at that time included what is now kentucky and west virginia  the boundary between ohio and kentucky and by implication west virginia is the northern low-water mark of the river as it existed in 1792. 30 ohio has only that portion of the river between the river s 1792 low-water mark and the present high-water mark the border with michigan has also changed as a result of the toledo war to angle slightly northeast to the north shore of the mouth of the maumee river much of ohio features glaciated till plains with an exceptionally flat area in the northwest being known as the great black swamp this glaciated region in the northwest and central state is bordered to the east and southeast first by a belt known as the glaciated allegheny plateau and then by another belt known as the unglaciated allegheny plateau most of ohio is of low relief but the unglaciated allegheny plateau features rugged hills and forests physical geography of ohio the rugged southeastern quadrant of ohio stretching in an outward bow-like arc along the ohio river from the west virginia panhandle to the outskirts of cincinnati forms a distinct socio-economic unit geologically similar to parts of west virginia and southwestern pennsylvania this area s coal mining legacy dependence on small pockets of old manufacturing establishments and distinctive regional dialect set this section off from the rest of the state in 1965 the united states congress passed the appalachian regional development act at attempt to address the persistent poverty and growing economic despair of the appalachian region 31 this act defines 29 ohio counties as part of appalachia 32 while 1 3 of ohio s land mass is part of the federally defined appalachian region only 12.8 of ohioans live there 1.476 million people 33 map of ohio significant rivers within the state include the cuyahoga river great miami river maumee river muskingum river and scioto river the rivers in the northern part of the state drain into the northern atlantic ocean via lake erie and the st lawrence river and the rivers in the southern part of the state drain into the gulf of mexico via the ohio river and then the mississippi the worst weather disaster in ohio history occurred along the great miami river in 1913. known as the great dayton flood the entire miami river watershed flooded including the downtown business district of dayton as a result the miami conservancy district was created as the first major flood plain engineering project in ohio and the united states 34 grand lake st marys in the west central part of the state was constructed as a supply of water for canals in the canal-building era of 1820–1850 for many years this body of water over 20 square miles 52 km2  was the largest artificial lake in the world it should be noted that ohio s canal-building projects were not the economic fiasco that similar efforts were in other states some cities such as dayton owe their industrial emergence to location on canals and as late as 1910 interior canals carried much of the bulk freight of the state climate köppen climate types in ohio the climate of ohio is a humid continental climate köppen climate classification dfa dfb throughout most of the state except in the extreme southern counties of ohio s bluegrass region section which are located on the northern periphery of the humid subtropical climate cfa and upland south region of the united states summers are typically hot and humid throughout the state while winters generally range from cool to cold precipitation in ohio is moderate year-round severe weather is not uncommon in the state although there are typically fewer tornado reports in ohio than in states located in what is known as the tornado alley severe lake effect snowstorms are also not uncommon on the southeast shore of lake erie which is located in an area designated as the snowbelt although predominantly not in a subtropical climate some warmer-climate flora and fauna does reach well into ohio for instance a number of trees with more southern ranges such as the blackjack oak quercus marilandica are found at their northernmost in ohio just north of the ohio river also evidencing this climatic transition from a subtropical to continental climate several plants such as the southern magnolia magnolia grandiflora  albizia julibrissin mimosa  crape myrtle and even the occasional needle palm are hardy landscape materials regularly used as street yard and garden plantings in the bluegrass region of ohio but these same plants will simply not thrive in much of the rest of the state this

suggests that the ohio valley was inhabited by nomadic people as early as 13,000 bc 51 these early nomads disappeared from ohio by 1,000 bc but their material culture provided a base for those who followed them  attribution needed 51 between 1,000 and 800 bc the sedentary adena culture emerged as ohio historian george w knepper notes this sophisticated culture was so named because evidences of their culture were excavated in 1902 on the grounds of adena thomas worthington s estate located near chillicothe  52 the adena were able to establish semi-permanent villages because they domesticated plants which included squash sunflowers and perhaps corn cultivation of these in addition to hunting and gathering supported more settled complex villages 52 the most spectacular remnant of the adena culture is the great serpent mound located in adams county ohio 52 iroquois conquests during the beaver wars mid-1600s  which largely depopulated the upper and mid-ohio river valley around 100 bc the adena evolved into the hopewell people who were named for the farm owned by captain m c hopewell where evidence of their unique culture was discovered 53 like the adena the hopewell people participated in a mound-building culture their complex large and technologically sophisticated earthworks can be found in modern-day marietta newark and circleville 53 they were also a powerful trading society managing to knit together a network that passed goods throughout a third of the continent 54 the hopewell however disappeared from the ohio valley in about 600 ad little is known about the people who replaced them although many siouan-speaking peoples from the plains east coast claim them as ancestors say they lived throughout the ohio region until approx the 13th century 55 it is possible that the rise of the mississippian culture was the downfall of the hopewell as they began to rise to prominence on the mississippi river around the same time that the hopewell culture died out researchers have identified three additional distinct prehistoric cultures the fort ancient people the whittlesey focus people 55 the monongahela culture 56 all three cultures apparently disappeared in the 17th century perhaps decimated by infectious diseases spread in epidemics from early european contact the native americans had no immunity to common european diseases no one has ever definitively concluded which historically known peoples they may have been analogous to that being said it is generally believed that the shawnees may have absorbed the fort ancient people 55 it s also possible that the monongahela held no land in ohio during by the colonial era the mississippian culture were close to contemporaneous with and traded extensively with the fort ancient people american indians in the ohio valley were greatly affected by the aggressive tactics of the iroquois confederation based in central and western new york 57 after the beaver wars in the mid-17th century the iroquois claimed much of the ohio country as hunting and more importantly beaver-trapping ground after the devastation of epidemics and war in the mid-17th century which largely emptied the ohio country of indigenous people by the mid-to-late 17th century the land gradually became repopulated by the mostly algonquian many of these ohio-country nations were multi-ethnic sometimes multi-linguistic societies born out of the earlier devastation brought about by disease war and subsequent social instability they subsisted on agriculture corn sunflowers beans etc supplemented by seasonal hunts by the 18th century they were part of a larger global economy brought about by european entry into the fur trade 58 the indigenous nations to inhabit ohio in the historical period included the iroquoian petun known for their tobacco plantations  erie thought to have been from northeast ohio western pennsylvania but may have come from canada  chonnonton conquered their way down from canada during beaver wars before being defeated by the iroquois confederacy their allies  wyandot a group of petun who became isolated around cleveland after the beaver wars commonly mistaken for the huron whom most surviving petun later joined  59 the mingo seneca split off from the iroquois confederacy moved to ohio in 18th century remained approx 100 years the iroquois confederacy conquered most of ohio at the bequest of the english in the 1660s pushed back to pennsylvania by french in 1701.  the algonquian miami mostly from indiana  mascouten close sister tribe to miamis scattered during beaver wars mostly relocated to kentucky lenape arrived around the turn of the 18th century from east coast  shawnee seceded from powhatan confederacy eventually came to ohio river most likely merged with several other lesser known people in the region odawa part of a confederacy that surrounded lake superior relocated to michigan northwest ohio around the american revolution the siouan mosopelea moved to arkansas during beaver wars  60 61 ohio country was also the site of indian massacres such as the yellow creek massacre gnadenhutten and pontiac s rebellion school massacre 62 most native peoples who remained in ohio were slowly bought out and convinced to leave or ordered to do so by law in the early 19th century with the indian removal act of 1830. colonial and revolutionary eras during the 18th century the french set up a system of trading posts to control the fur trade in the region beginning in 1754, france and great britain fought a war that was known in north america as the french and indian war and in europe as the seven years war as a result of the treaty of paris the french ceded control of ohio and the remainder of the old northwest to great britain pontiac s rebellion in the 1760s however posed a challenge to british military control 63 this came to an end with the colonists victory in the american revolution in the treaty of paris in 1783, britain ceded all claims to ohio country to the united states northwest territory 1787–1803 plaque commemorating the northwest ordinance outside federal hall national memorial in new york the united states created the northwest territory under the northwest ordinance of 1787. 64 slavery was not permitted in the new territory settlement began with the founding of marietta by the ohio company of associates which had been formed by a group of american revolutionary war veterans following the ohio company the miami company also referred to as the symmes purchase claimed the southwestern section and the connecticut land company surveyed and settled the connecticut western reserve in present-day northeast ohio the old northwest territory originally included areas previously known as ohio country and illinois country as ohio prepared for statehood the indiana territory was created reducing the northwest territory to approximately the size of present-day ohio plus the eastern half of the lower peninsula of michigan and the eastern tip of the upper peninsula under the northwest ordinance areas of the territory could be defined and admitted as states once their population reached 60,000. although ohio s population numbered only 45,000 in december 1801, congress determined that the population was growing rapidly and ohio could begin the path to statehood the assumption was that it would exceed 60,000 residents by the time it was admitted as a state furthermore in regards to the leni lenape native americans living in the region congress decided that 10,000 acres on the muskingum river in the present state of ohio would be set apart and the property thereof be vested in the moravian brethren . or a society of the said brethren for civilizing the indians and promoting christianity  65 statehood 1803–present james a garfield president of the united states from ohio on february 19, 1803, u.s president thomas jefferson signed an act of congress that approved ohio s boundaries and constitution 66 however congress had never passed a resolution formally admitting ohio as the 17th state the current custom of congress declaring an official date of statehood did not begin until 1812, disputed – discuss with louisiana s admission as the 18th state although no formal resolution of admission was required when the oversight was discovered in 1953, ohio congressman george h bender introduced a bill in congress to admit ohio to the union retroactive to march 1, 1803, the date on which the ohio general assembly first convened 67 at a special session at the old state capital in chillicothe the ohio state legislature approved a new petition for statehood that was delivered to washington d.c on horseback on august 7, 1953 the year of ohio s 150th anniversary  president eisenhower signed a congressional joint resolution that officially declared march 1, 1803, the date of ohio s admittance into the union 67 68 69 ohio has had three capital cities chillicothe zanesville and columbus chillicothe was the capital from 1803 to 1810. the capital was then moved to zanesville for two years as part of a state legislative compromise in order to get a bill passed the capital was then moved back to chillicothe which was the capital from 1812 to 1816. finally the capital was moved to columbus in order to have it near the geographic center of the state where it would be more accessible to most citizens although many native americans had migrated west to evade american encroachment others remained settled in the state sometimes assimilating in part shawnee leader tecumseh led an american indian confederacy in tecumseh s rebellion from 1811 to 1813. in 1830 under president andrew jackson the us government forced indian removal of most tribes to the indian territory west of the mississippi river in 1835, ohio fought with michigan in the toledo war a mostly bloodless boundary war over the toledo strip only one person was injured in the conflict congress intervened making michigan s admittance as a state conditional on ending the conflict in exchange for giving up its claim to the toledo strip michigan was given the western two-thirds of the upper peninsula in addition to the eastern third that was already considered part of the state ohio state welcome sign in an older 1990s style newer state sign us 52 ohio s central position and its population gave it an important place during the civil war the ohio river was a vital artery for troop and supply movements as were ohio s railroads the industry of ohio made the state one of the most important states in the union during the civil war ohio contributed more soldiers per-capita than any other state in the union in 1862, the state s morale was badly shaken in the aftermath of the battle of shiloh a costly victory in which ohio forces suffered 2,000 casualties 70 later that year when confederate troops under the leadership of stonewall jackson threatened washington d.c. ohio governor david tod still could recruit 5,000 volunteers to provide three months of service 71 from july 12 to july 23, 1863, southern ohio and indiana were attacked in morgan s raid while this raid was insignificant and small it aroused fear among people in ohio and indiana 72 almost 35,000 ohioans died in the conflict and 30,000 were physically wounded 73 by the end of the civil war the union s top three generals–ulysses s grant william tecumseh sherman and philip sheridan–were all from ohio 74 75 in 1912 a constitutional convention was held with charles b galbreath as secretary the result reflected the concerns of the progressive era it introduced the initiative and the referendum in addition it allowed the general assembly to put questions on the ballot for the people to ratify laws and constitutional amendments originating in the legislature under the jeffersonian principle that laws should be reviewed once a generation the constitution provided for a recurring question to appear on ohio s general election ballots every 20 years the question asks whether a new convention is required although the question has appeared in 1932, 1952, 1972, and 1992, it has never been approved instead constitutional amendments have been proposed by petition to the legislature hundreds of times and adopted in a majority of cases eight us presidents hailed from ohio at the time of their elections giving rise to its nickname mother of presidents  a sobriquet it shares with virginia it is also termed modern mother of presidents  76 in contrast to virginia s status as the origin of presidents earlier in american history seven presidents were born in ohio making it second to virginia s eight virginia-born william henry harrison lived most of his life in ohio and is also buried there harrison conducted his political career while living on the family compound founded by his father-in-law john cleves symmes in north bend ohio the seven presidents born in ohio were ulysses s
