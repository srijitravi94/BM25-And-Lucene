ontario and southern ontario the great majority of ontario s population and arable land is in the south in contrast the larger northern part of ontario is sparsely populated with cold winters and heavy forestation etymology edit the province is named after lake ontario a term thought to be derived from ontarí io a huron wyandot word meaning great lake  13 or possibly skanadario which means beautiful water in the iroquoian languages 14 ontario has about 250,000 freshwater lakes 15 geography edit main article geography of ontario see also census divisions of ontario and geography of canada see also list of parks and protected areas of ontario algonquin provincial park cache lake in the autumn of 2006. the province consists of three main geographical regions the thinly populated canadian shield in the northwestern and central portions which comprises over half the land area of ontario although this area mostly does not support agriculture it is rich in minerals and in part covered by the central and midwestern canadian shield forests studded with lakes and rivers northern ontario is subdivided into two sub-regions northwestern ontario and northeastern ontario the virtually unpopulated hudson bay lowlands in the extreme north and northeast mainly swampy and sparsely forested southern ontario which is further sub-divided into four regions central ontario although not actually the province s geographic centre  eastern ontario golden horseshoe and southwestern ontario parts of which were formerly referred to as western ontario  despite the absence of any mountainous terrain in the province there are large areas of uplands particularly within the canadian shield which traverses the province from northwest to southeast and also above the niagara escarpment which crosses the south the highest point is ishpatina ridge at 693 metres 2,274 ft above sea level in temagami northeastern ontario in the south elevations of over 500 m 1,640 ft are surpassed near collingwood above the blue mountains in the dundalk highlands and in hilltops near the madawaska river in renfrew county the carolinian forest zone covers most of the southwestern region of the province the temperate and fertile great lakes-saint lawrence valley in the south is part of the eastern great lakes lowland forests ecoregion where the forest has now been largely replaced by agriculture industrial and urban development a well-known geographic feature is niagara falls part of the niagara escarpment the saint lawrence seaway allows navigation to and from the atlantic ocean as far inland as thunder bay in northwestern ontario northern ontario occupies roughly 87 percent of the surface area of the province conversely southern ontario contains 94 percent of

ontario summer at sandbanks provincial park on lake ontario the climate of ontario varies by season and location 16 it is affected by three air sources cold dry arctic air from the north dominant factor during the winter months and for a longer part of the year in far northern ontario pacific polar air crossing in from the western canadian prairies us northern plains and warm moist air from the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean 17 the effects of these major air masses on temperature and precipitation depend mainly on latitude proximity to major bodies of water and to a small extent terrain relief 17 in general most of ontario s climate is classified as humid continental 17 ontario has three main climatic regions the surrounding great lakes greatly influence the climatic region of southern ontario 16 during the fall and winter months heat stored from the lakes is released moderating the climate near the shores of the lakes 18 this gives some parts of southern ontario milder winters than mid-continental areas at lower latitudes 18 parts of southwestern ontario generally south of a line from sarnia-toronto have a moderate humid continental climate köppen climate classification dfa  similar to that of the inland mid-atlantic states and the great lakes portion of the midwestern united states the region has warm to hot humid summers and cold winters annual precipitation ranges from 750–1,000 mm 30–39 in and is well distributed throughout the year most of this region lies in the lee of the great lakes making for abundant snow in some areas in december 2010, the snowbelt set a new record when it was hit by more than a metre of snow within 48 hours 19 the next climatic region is central and eastern ontario which has a moderate humid continental climate köppen dfb  this region has warm and sometimes hot summers with colder longer winters ample snowfall even in regions not directly in the snowbelts and annual precipitation similar to the rest of southern ontario 17 the niagara escarpment on the bruce peninsula in the northeastern parts of ontario extending far as south as kirkland lake the cold waters of hudson bay depress summer temperatures making it cooler than other locations at similar latitudes the same is true on the northern shore of lake superior which cools hot humid air from the south leading to cooler summer temperatures 17 along the eastern shores of lake superior and lake huron winter temperatures are slightly moderated but come with frequent heavy lake-effect snow squalls that increase seasonal snowfall totals upwards of 3 m 10 ft in some places these regions have higher annual precipitation in some case over 100 cm 39 in  the northernmost parts of ontario – primarily north of 50°n – have a subarctic climate köppen dfc with long severely cold winters and short cool to warm summers with dramatic temperature changes possible in all seasons with no major mountain ranges blocking sinking arctic air masses temperatures of −40 °c −40 °f are not uncommon snowfall remains on the ground for sometimes over half the year snowfall accumulation can be high in some areas 16 precipitation is generally less than 70 cm 28 in and peaks in the summer months in the form of showers or thunderstorms 16 severe thunderstorms peak in summer london situated in southern southwestern ontario has the most lightning strikes per year in canada averaging 34 days of thunderstorm activity per year in a typical year ontario averages 11 confirmed tornado touchdowns however over the last 4 years when it has had upwards of 20 tornado touchdowns per year with the highest frequency occurring in the windsor-essex – chatham kent area though few are very destructive the majority between f0 to f2 on the fujita scale  ontario had a record 29 tornadoes in both 2006 and 2009. tropical depression remnants occasionally bring heavy rains and winds in the south but are rarely deadly a notable exception was

administrative units until a treaty had been concluded with the aboriginal people ceding the land in 1788, while part of the province of quebec southern ontario was divided into four districts hesse lunenburg mecklenburg and nassau in 1792, the four districts were renamed hesse became the western district lunenburg became the eastern district mecklenburg became the midland district and nassau became the home district counties were created within the districts by 1798, there were eight districts eastern home johnstown london midland newcastle niagara and western by 1826, there were eleven

johnstown london midland newcastle niagara ottawa prince edward simcoe talbot victoria wellington and western in 1849, the districts of southern ontario were abolished by the province of canada and county governments took over certain municipal responsibilities the province of canada also began creating districts in sparsely populated northern ontario with the establishment of algoma district and nipissing district in 1858. the borders of ontario its new name in 1867, were provisionally expanded north and west when the province of canada was formed its borders were not entirely clear and ontario claimed eventually to reach all the way to the rocky mountains and arctic ocean with canada s acquisition of rupert s land ontario was interested in clearly defining its borders especially since some of the new areas in which it was interested were rapidly growing after the federal government asked ontario to pay for construction in the new disputed area the province asked for an elaboration on its limits and its boundary was moved north to the 51st parallel north 30 the northern and western boundaries of ontario were in dispute after canadian confederation ontario s right to northwestern ontario was determined by the judicial committee of the privy council in 1884 and confirmed by the canada ontario boundary act 1889 of the parliament of the united kingdom by 1899, there were seven northern districts algoma manitoulin muskoka nipissing parry sound rainy river and thunder bay four more northern districts were created between 1907 and 1912 cochrane kenora sudbury and timiskaming 31 european contact edit statue of united empire loyalists in downtown hamilton on main street east prior to the arrival of the europeans the region was inhabited by algonquian ojibwa cree and algonquin in the northern western portions and iroquois and wyandot huron tribes more in the south east 32 during the 17th century the algonquians and hurons fought the beaver wars against the iroquois 33 the french explorer étienne brûlé explored part of the area in 1610–12 34 the english explorer henry hudson sailed into hudson bay in 1611 and claimed the area for england samuel de champlain reached lake huron in 1615, and french missionaries began to establish posts along the great lakes french settlement was hampered by their hostilities with the iroquois who allied themselves with the british 35 from 1634 to 1640, hurons were devastated by european infectious diseases such as measles and smallpox to which they had no immunity 36 by 1700, the iroquois had seceded from ontario and the mississaugas of the ojibwa had settled the north shore of lake ontario the british established trading posts on hudson bay in the late 17th century and began a struggle for domination of ontario the 1763 treaty of paris ended the seven years war by awarding nearly all of france s north american possessions new france to britain the region was annexed to quebec in 1774. 37 the first european settlements were in 1782–1784 when 5,000 american loyalists entered what is now ontario following the american revolution 38 the kingdom of great britain granted them 200 acres 81 ha land and other items with which to rebuild their lives 35 the british also set up reservations in ontario for the mohawks who had fought for the british and had lost their land in new york state other iroquois were resettled in 1784 at the six nations reserve at the west end of lake ontario the population of canada west of the st lawrence-ottawa river confluence substantially increased during this period a fact recognized by the constitutional act of 1791, which split quebec into the canadas upper canada southwest of the st lawrence-ottawa river confluence and lower canada east of it john graves simcoe was appointed upper canada s first lieutenant governor in 1793. 39 upper canada edit main article upper canada american troops in the war of 1812 invaded upper canada across the niagara river and the detroit river but were defeated and pushed back by the british canadian fencibles and militias and first nations warriors however eventually the americans gained control of lake erie and lake ontario during the battle of york in 1813, american troops occupied the town of york the americans looted the town and burned the parliament buildings during the brief occupation after the war of 1812, relative stability allowed for increasing numbers of immigrants to arrive from europe rather than from the united states as was the case in the previous decades this immigration shift was encouraged by the colonial leaders despite affordable and often free land many arriving newcomers mostly from britain and ireland found frontier life with the harsh climate difficult and some of those with the means eventually returned home or went south however population growth far exceeded emigration in the decades that followed it was a mostly agrarian-based society but canal projects and a new network of plank roads spurred greater trade within the colony and with the united states thereby improving previously damaged relations over time lower ontario in 1718, guillaume de l isle map approximate province area highlighted meanwhile ontario s numerous waterways aided travel and transportation into the interior and supplied water power for development as the population increased so did the industries and transportation networks which in turn led to further development by the end of the century ontario vied with quebec as the nation s leader in terms of growth in population industry arts and communications 40 unrest in the colony began to chafe against the aristocratic family compact who governed while benefiting economically from the region s resources and who did not allow elected bodies power this resentment spurred republican ideals and sowed the seeds for early canadian nationalism accordingly rebellion in favour of responsible government rose in both regions louis-joseph papineau led the lower canada rebellion and william lyon mackenzie led the upper canada rebellion canada west edit main article province of canada although both rebellions were put down in short order the british government sent lord durham to investigate the causes of the unrest he recommended that self-government be granted and that lower and upper canada be re-joined in an attempt to assimilate the french canadians accordingly the two colonies were merged into the province of canada by the act of union 1840, with the capital at kingston and upper canada becoming known as canada west parliamentary self-government was granted in 1848. there were heavy waves of immigration in the 1840s and the population of canada west more than doubled by 1851 over the previous decade as a result for the first time the english-speaking population of canada west surpassed the french-speaking population of canada east tilting the representative balance of power an economic boom in the 1850s coincided with railway expansion across the province further increasing the economic strength of central canada with the repeal of the corn laws and a reciprocity agreement in place with united states various industries such as timber mining farming and alcohol distilling benefited tremendously a political stalemate between the french- and english-speaking legislators as well as fear of aggression from the united states during and immediately after the american civil war led the political elite to hold a series of conferences in the 1860s to effect a broader federal union of all british north american colonies the british north america act took effect on july 1, 1867, establishing the dominion of canada initially with four provinces nova scotia new brunswick quebec and ontario the province of canada was divided into ontario and quebec so that each linguistic group would have its own province both quebec and ontario were required by section 93 of the british north america act to safeguard existing educational rights and privileges of protestant and the catholic minority thus separate catholic schools and school boards were permitted in ontario however neither province had a constitutional requirement to protect its french- or english-speaking minority toronto was formally established as ontario s provincial capital provincehood edit downtown london at night celebrating v-e day in ottawa in 1945 toronto the capital of ontario once constituted as a province ontario proceeded to assert its economic and legislative power in 1872, the lawyer oliver mowat became premier of ontario and remained as premier until 1896. he fought for provincial rights weakening the power of the federal government in provincial matters usually through well-argued appeals to the judicial committee of the privy council his battles with the federal government greatly decentralized canada giving the provinces far more power than john a macdonald had intended he consolidated and expanded ontario s educational and provincial institutions created districts in northern ontario and fought to ensure that those parts of northwestern ontario not historically part of upper canada the vast areas north and west of the lake superior-hudson bay watershed known as the district of keewatin would become part of ontario a victory embodied in the canada ontario boundary act 1889. he also presided over the emergence of the province into the economic powerhouse of canada mowat was the creator of what is often called empire ontario beginning with sir john a macdonald s national policy 1879 and the construction of the canadian pacific railway 1875–1885 through northern ontario and the canadian prairies to british columbia ontario manufacturing and industry flourished however population increase slowed after a large recession hit the province in 1893, thus slowing growth drastically but for only a few years many newly arrived immigrants and others moved west along the railway to the prairie provinces and british columbia sparsely settling northern ontario mineral exploitation accelerated in the late 19th century leading to the rise of important mining centres in the northeast such as sudbury cobalt and timmins the province harnessed its water power to generate hydro-electric power and created the state-controlled hydro-electric power commission of ontario later ontario hydro the availability of cheap electric power further facilitated the development of industry the ford motor company of canada was established in 1904. general motors canada was formed in 1918. the motor vehicle industry became the most lucrative industry for the ontario economy during the 20th century in july 1912, the conservative government of sir james whitney issued regulation 17 which severely limited the availability of french-language schooling to the province s french-speaking minority french canadians reacted with outrage journalist henri bourassa denouncing the prussians of ontario  the regulation was eventually repealed in 1927. influenced by events in the united states the government of sir william hearst introduced prohibition of alcoholic drinks in 1916 with the passing of the ontario temperance act however residents could distill and retain their own personal supply and liquor producers could continue distillation and export for sale allowing this already sizeable industry to strengthen further ontario became a hotbed for the illegal smuggling of liquor and the biggest supplier into the united states which was under complete prohibition prohibition in ontario came to an end in 1927 with the establishment of the liquor control board of ontario under the government of howard ferguson the sale and consumption of liquor wine and beer are still controlled by some of the most extreme laws in north america to ensure that strict community standards and revenue generation from the alcohol retail monopoly are upheld in april 2007, ontario member of provincial parliament kim craitor suggested that local brewers should be able to sell their beer in local corner stores however the motion was quickly rejected by premier dalton mcguinty the post-world war ii period was one of exceptional prosperity and growth ontario has been the recipients of most immigration to canada largely immigrants from war-torn europe in the 1950s and 1960s and following changes in federal immigration law a massive influx of non-europeans since the 1970s from a largely ethnically british province ontario has rapidly become culturally very diverse the nationalist movement in quebec particularly after the election of the parti québécois in 1976, contributed to driving many businesses and english-speaking people out of quebec to ontario and as a result toronto surpassed montreal as the largest city and economic centre of canada citation needed depressed economic conditions in the maritime provinces have also resulted in de-population of those
