potential part of opsek 10 2009, poisk mrm-2 - potential part of opsek poisk russian по́иск lit search  also known as the mini-research module 2 mrm 2  малый исследовательский модуль 2, or мим 2. poisk is a russian airlock module with two identical hatches its predecessor pirs is used to store service and refurbish russian orlan suits the outermost docking ports on both airlocks allow docking of soyuz and progress spacecraft and the automatic transfer of propellants to and from storage on the station 11 rassvet left of center with the russian science airlock temporarily stored on its side 2018, nauka fgb-2 - to form part of opsek nauka russian нау́ка lit science  also known as the multipurpose laboratory module mlm or fgb-2 russian многофункциональный лабораторный модуль or млм  is the major russian laboratory module this module will be separated from the iss before de-orbit with support modules to become the opsek space station it contains an additional set of life support systems and orientation control nauka s mission has changed over time during the mid-1990s it was intended as a backup for the first fgb and later as a universal docking module udm  its docking ports will be able to support automatic docking of both spacecraft additional modules and fuel transfer prior to the arrival of the mlm a progress robotic spacecraft will dock with the iss pirs module depart with that module and both will be discarded nauka will then use its own engines to attach itself to the ros after 2014. 12 the european robotic arm which will service the russian orbital segment will be launched alongside the mlm 13 computer generated image of the ros after nauka docking 2018, uzlovoy module - to form part of opsek node module um nm this 4-ton ball shaped module will support the docking of two scientific and power modules during the final stage of the station assembly and provide the russian segment additional docking ports to receive soyuz tma transportation modified anthropometric and progress m spacecraft nm is to be incorporated into the iss in 2016. it will be integrated with a special version of the progress cargo ship and launched by a standard soyuz rocket the progress would use its own propulsion and flight control system to deliver and dock the node module to the nadir earth-facing docking port of the nauka mlm fgb-2 module one port is equipped with an active hybrid docking port which enables docking with the mlm module the remaining five ports are passive hybrids enabling docking of soyuz and progress vehicles as well as heavier modules and future spacecraft with modified docking systems more importantly the node module was conceived to serve as the only permanent element of opsek equipped with six docking ports the node module would serve as a single permanent core of the future station with all other modules coming and going as their life span and mission required 14 15 uzlovoy will be launched after nauka mlm launch dates will be 2017 or later 16 science and power module 1 nem-1 - to form part of opsek 17 ros modules not utilized in opsek edit russian orbital segment modules scheduled for de-orbiting 2014, pirs dc-1 - to be de-orbited before the launch of mlm nauka and that module will utilize the current pirs port at the iss russian orbital segment modules that are neither scheduled for de-orbit nor included in the opsek proposals 1998, zarya fgb-1 - owned by nasa 18 could be traded for soyuz progress flights after currently contracted flights 19 20 21 are exhausted 2010, rassvet mrm-1 - currently docked at zarya 22 if zarya is not utilized in opsek it would have to be moved to another ros opsek docking location
