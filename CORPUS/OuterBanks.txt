bodie island which used to be an island but is now a peninsula due to tropical storms and hurricanes  hatteras island ocracoke island portsmouth island and the core banks 4 over time the exact number of islands and inlets changes as new inlets are opened up often during a breach created during violent storms and older inlets close usually due to gradually sifting sands during the dynamic processes of beach evolution the outer banks stretch southward from sandbridge in virginia beach down the north carolina coastline sources differ regarding the southern terminus of the outer banks generations

hatteras on hatteras island site of the cape hatteras lighthouse the outer banks are not anchored to offshore coral reefs like some other barrier islands and as a consequence they often suffer significant beach erosion during major storms in fact their location jutting out into the atlantic makes them the most hurricane-prone area north of florida for both landfalling storms and brushing storms offshore hatteras island was cut in half on september 18, 2003, when hurricane isabel washed a 2,000 foot 600 m wide and 15 foot 5 m deep channel called isabel inlet through the community of

by hurricanes nor easters usually in the form of rain and rarely snow or mixed precipitation  and other ocean-driven storms the winters are typically milder than in inland areas averaging lows in the upper 30s and highs in the lower 50s and is more frequently overcast than in the summer however the exposure of the outer banks makes them prone to higher winds often causing wind chills to make the apparent temperature as cold as the inland areas the summer months average lows from the mid-70s to highs in the upper 80s depending on the time of the summer the spring and fall are typically milder seasons the fall and winter are usually warmer than areas inland while the spring and the summer are often slightly cooler because of the moderating effects of being surrounded by water although snow is possible averaging from 3 inches in the north to less than 1 2 inch per year in the south there are many times when years pass between snowfalls 15 the majority of nor easters are born off the coasts of the outer banks culture edit graveyard of the atlantic museum hatteras north carolina june 2007 the outer banks were first settled by english european colonial settlers many of whom still have descendants living on the islands to this day before bridges were built in the 1930s the only form of transport between or off the islands was by boat which allowed for the islands to stay isolated from much of the rest of the mainland this helped to preserve the maritime culture and the distinctive outer banks accent or brogue which sounds more like an english accent than it does an american accent many bankers have often been mistaken for being from england or ireland when traveling to areas outside of the outer banks the brogue is more distinctive the further south one travels on the outer banks with it being the thickest on ocracoke island and harkers island some residents of the outer banks known as wreckers made part of their living by scavenging wrecked ships—or by luring ships to their destruction horses with lanterns tied to their necks would be walked along the beach the lanterns up and down motion would appear to ships to represent clear water and a ship ahead the unsuspecting captain would then drive his ship ashore following this false light 16 the islands are home to herds of feral horses sometimes called banker ponies which according to local legend are descended from spanish mustangs washed ashore centuries ago in shipwrecks populations are found on ocracoke island shackleford banks currituck banks and in the rachel carson estuarine

of the 1600s but once they were ridden the local settlers used fishing as their lifeline 20 then in the mid-19th century large-scale commercial fishing erupted mostly due to the construction of the albemarle and chesapeake canal which simplified shipping methods for fishermen 20 saltwater fishing became the cash-crop of the outer banks and blossomed it into a popular tourist destination 20 in modern times tourists will flock to the area just for the abundance of fishing opportunities 19 anglers otherwise known as fishermen have a wide range of fishing methods some of these methods date back to when the first settlers arrived to choose from in the outer banks 20 fly fishing this was brought about in the 1950s when modern fly fishing experts like joe brooks and jimmy albright were successfully catching a variety of gamefish on the flats of the florida keys and on the currituck sound which is included in the stretch of the outer banks 21 modern fly fishers in the outer banks pursue a variety of gamefish from red drum to marlin and tuna 21 brackish fishing this is a separate type of fishing than complete saltwater because of the abundance of new species that are able to live in brackish water 22 the outer banks has multiple sounds that receive water from the atlantic ocean and many north carolina fresh-water rivers creating an estuary for many types of fish including striped bass puppy drum and speckled trout 22 offshore fishing thriving in the outer banks this is the type of fishing this area is known for 19 offshore fishing is the method of heading out to sea to the gulf stream where giant species such as billfish tuna and dolphin lurk 23 anglers can book charters or use their own personal boat but a larger boat is necessary to reach the deep water where the big fish are prevalent 19 inshore fishing guides local to the outer banks will often escort new anglers around the area to sounds and piers where they are guaranteed a catch 24 whether the customer is a novice or veteran with their fishing skills the inshore guide is someone that is there to help 24 pier fishing the outer banks are one of the few coastal areas left with more than one fishing pier along the coast so anglers attract to the area for an opportunity to pier fish 25 pier fishing is an easy way for anglers to get a little off-shore mixed with some inshore fishing 25 it is where fishermen can catch any type of fish they please as long as it is the season for it 25 the outer banks are a popular destination for bottom fish like spot and mullet these two types of fish are caught throughout the year 26 the peak for fishing bottom and top water feeders is early to the middle of may 26 if the angler is solely searching for top water fish then late may and june would be the ideal time to fish especially if they are searching for mackerel 26 in the offseason or winter months the true fishermen are out searching for trout sea bass bluefish bluefin tuna oysters king mackerel bay scallops and striped bass 23 in the spring the popular catches are grouper sea trout sea bass bluefish bluefin and yellowfin tuna oysters snapper striped bass red drum croaker sea mullet king mackerel and wahoo 23 late spring and the beginning of summer is the favored time for top-water fish to move into the coastal waters near the outer banks because of the warming waters and the increased visibility in the water 26 the top water fish can see baitfish easily due to the decrease in murky water 26 plus they will start to migrate back north as the coastal waters to the south become too hot the waters farther north will warm to their desired temperatures 26 yet in the prime tourist season of the summer fishermen and many tourists have plenty of game options such as blue marlin white marlin dolphin wahoo cobia king mackerel bluefish tuna flounder snapper grouper spanish mackerel crabs soft crabs shrimp spot croaker sailfish and sea mullet 19 by the fall most tourists have started to leave but fishermen are still out searching for snapper channel bass bluefish king mackerel grouper tuna oysters striped bass sea mullet spot clams speckled trout flounder and shrimp 19 the prime season for fall fishing is late september to october 23. 26 though the water is more turbulent and murky due to the strong northeast prevailing winds there is still some big game fish left 26 most of these fish are vacating back to the south for the warm waters 19 this makes it a prime time for smaller bottom fish who love to feed in murky colder water 26 communities edit towns and communities
