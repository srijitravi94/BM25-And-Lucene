indian pacific southern world ocean v t e the pacific ocean is the largest and deepest of earth s oceanic divisions it extends from the arctic ocean in the north to the southern ocean or depending on definition to antarctica in the south and is bounded by asia and australia in the west and the americas in the east at 165,250,000 square kilometers 63,800,000 square miles in area as defined with an antarctic southern border  this largest division of the world ocean—and in turn the hydrosphere—covers about 46 of earth s water surface and about one-third of its total surface area making it larger than all of earth s land area combined 1 both the center of the water hemisphere and the western hemisphere are in the pacific ocean the equator subdivides it into the north pacific ocean and south pacific ocean with two exceptions the galápagos and gilbert islands while straddling the equator are deemed wholly within the south pacific 2 its mean depth is 4,280 meters 14,040 feet  the mariana trench in the western north pacific is the deepest point in the world reaching a depth of 10,911 meters 35,797 feet  3 the western pacific has many peripheral seas though the peoples of asia and oceania have traveled the pacific ocean since prehistoric times the eastern pacific was first sighted by europeans in the early 16th century when spanish explorer vasco núñez de balboa crossed the isthmus of panama in 1513 and discovered the great southern sea which he named mar del sur in spanish  the ocean s current name was coined by portuguese explorer ferdinand magellan during the spanish circumnavigation of the world in 1521, as he encountered favorable winds on reaching the ocean he called it mar pacífico which in both portuguese and spanish means peaceful sea  4 history edit early migrations edit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it october 2017 universalis cosmographia the waldseemüller map dated 1507, from a time when the nature of the americas was ambiguous particularly north america as a possible part of asia was the first map to show the americas separating two distinct oceans south america was generally considered a new world and shows the name america for the first time after amerigo vespucci made in 1529, the diogo ribeiro map was the first to show the pacific at about its proper size maris pacifici by ortelius 1589  one of the first printed maps to show the pacific ocean 5 important human migrations occurred in the pacific in prehistoric times about 3000 bc the austronesian peoples on the island of taiwan mastered the art of long-distance canoe travel and spread themselves and their languages south to the philippines indonesia and maritime southeast asia west towards madagascar southeast towards new guinea and melanesia intermarrying with native papuans and east to the islands of micronesia oceania and polynesia 6 long-distance trade developed all along the coast from mozambique to japan trade and therefore knowledge extended to the indonesian islands but apparently not australia by at least 878 when there was a significant islamic settlement in canton much of this trade was controlled by arabs or muslims in 219 bc xu fu sailed out into the pacific searching for the elixir of immortality from 1404 to 1433 zheng he led expeditions into the indian ocean european exploration edit map of the pacific ocean during european exploration circa 1702–1707 map of the pacific ocean during european exploration circa 1754. the first contact of european navigators with the western edge of the pacific ocean was made by the portuguese expeditions of antónio de abreu and francisco serrão via the lesser sunda islands to the maluku islands in 1512, 7 8 and with jorge álvares s expedition to southern china in 1513, 9 both ordered by afonso de albuquerque from malacca the east side of the ocean was discovered by spanish explorer vasco núñez de balboa in 1513 after his expedition crossed the isthmus of panama and reached a new ocean 10 he named it mar del sur literally sea of the south or south sea because the ocean was to the south of the coast of the isthmus where he first observed the pacific later portuguese explorer ferdinand magellan sailed the pacific east to west on a castilian spanish expedition of world circumnavigation starting in 1519. magellan called the ocean pacífico or pacific meaning peaceful because after sailing through the stormy seas off cape horn the expedition found calm waters the ocean was often called the sea of magellan in his honor until the eighteenth century 11 although magellan himself died in the philippines in 1521, spanish basque navigator juan sebastián elcano led the expedition back to spain across the indian ocean and round the cape of good hope completing the first world circumnavigation in a single expedition in 1522. 12 sailing around and east of the moluccas between 1525 and 1527, portuguese expeditions discovered the caroline islands 13 the aru islands 14 and papua new guinea 15 in 1542–43 the portuguese also reached japan 16 in 1564, five spanish ships consisting of 379 explorers crossed the ocean from mexico led by miguel lópez de legazpi and sailed to the philippines and mariana islands 17 for the remainder of the 16th century spanish influence was paramount with ships sailing from mexico and peru across the pacific ocean to the philippines via guam and establishing the spanish east indies the manila galleons operated for two and a half centuries linking manila and acapulco in one of the longest trade routes in history spanish expeditions also discovered tuvalu the marquesas the cook islands the solomon islands and the admiralty islands in the south pacific 18 later in the quest for terra australis i.e. the great southern land  spanish explorations in the 17th century such as the expedition led by the portuguese navigator pedro fernandes de queirós discovered the pitcairn and vanuatu archipelagos and sailed the torres strait between australia and new guinea named after navigator luís vaz de torres dutch explorers sailing around southern africa also engaged in discovery and trade willem janszoon made the first completely documented european landing in australia 1606  in cape york peninsula 19 and abel janszoon tasman circumnavigated and landed on parts of the australian continental coast and discovered tasmania and new zealand in 1642. 20 in the 16th and 17th century spain considered the pacific ocean a mare clausum—a sea closed to other naval powers as the only known entrance from the atlantic the strait of magellan was at times patrolled by fleets sent to prevent entrance of non-spanish ships on the western end of the pacific ocean the dutch threatened the spanish philippines 21 the 18th century marked the beginning of major exploration by the russians in alaska and the aleutian islands such as the first kamchatka expedition and the great northern expedition led by the danish russian navy officer vitus bering spain also sent expeditions to the pacific northwest reaching vancouver island in southern canada and alaska the french explored and settled polynesia and the british made three voyages with james cook to the south pacific and australia hawaii and the north american pacific northwest in 1768, pierre-antoine véron a young astronomer accompanying louis antoine de bougainville on his voyage of exploration established the width of the pacific with precision for the first time in history 22 one of the earliest voyages of scientific exploration was organized by spain in the malaspina expedition of 1789–1794 it sailed vast areas of the pacific from cape horn to alaska guam and the philippines new zealand australia and the south pacific 18 new imperialism edit

policarpo toro managed to negotiate an incorporation of the island into chile with native rapanui in 1888. by occupying easter island chile joined the imperial nations 24 p53 by 1900 nearly all pacific islands were in control of britain france united states germany japan and chile 23 although the united states gained control of guam and the philippines from spain in 1898, 25 japan controlled most of the western pacific by 1914 and occupied many other islands during world war ii however by the end of that war japan was defeated and the u.s pacific fleet was the virtual master of the ocean since the end of world war ii many former colonies in the pacific have become independent states geography edit sunset over the pacific ocean as seen from the international space station anvil tops of thunderclouds are also visible the pacific separates asia and australia from the americas it may be further subdivided by the equator into northern north pacific and southern south pacific portions it extends from the antarctic region in the south to the arctic in the north 1 the pacific ocean encompasses approximately one-third of the earth s surface having an area of 165,200,000 km2 63,800,000 sq mi —significantly larger than earth s entire landmass of some 150,000,000 km2 58,000,000 sq mi  26 extending approximately 15,500 km 9,600 mi from the bering sea in the arctic to the northern extent

plate tectonics the pacific ocean is currently shrinking by roughly 2.5 cm 1 in per year on three sides roughly averaging 0.52 km2 0.20 sq mi a year by contrast the atlantic ocean is increasing in size 28 29 along the pacific ocean s irregular western margins lie many seas the largest of which are the celebes sea coral sea east china sea philippine sea sea of japan south china sea sulu sea tasman sea and yellow sea the indonesian seaway including the strait of malacca and torres strait joins the pacific and the indian ocean to the west and drake passage and the strait of magellan link the pacific with the atlantic ocean on the east to the north the bering strait connects the pacific with the arctic ocean 30 as the pacific straddles the 180th meridian the west pacific or western pacific near asia is in the eastern hemisphere while the east pacific or eastern pacific near the americas is in the western hemisphere 31 the southern pacific ocean harbors the southeast indian ridge crossing from south of australia turning into the pacific-antarctic ridge north of the south pole and merges with another ridge south of south america to form the east pacific rise which also connects with another ridge south of north america which overlooks the juan de fuca ridge for most of magellan s voyage from the strait of magellan to the philippines the explorer indeed found the ocean peaceful however the pacific is not always peaceful many tropical storms batter the islands of the pacific 32 the lands around the pacific rim are full of volcanoes and often affected by earthquakes

and west of the international date line includes the mariana islands in the northwest the caroline islands in the center the marshall islands to the west and the islands of kiribati in the southeast 40 41 melanesia to the southwest includes new guinea the world s second largest island after greenland and by far the largest of the pacific islands the other main melanesian groups from north to

encompasses tuvalu tokelau samoa tonga and the kermadec islands to the west the cook islands society islands and austral islands in the center and the marquesas islands tuamotu mangareva islands and easter island to the east 43 islands in the pacific ocean are of four basic types continental islands high islands coral reefs and uplifted coral platforms continental islands lie outside the andesite line and include new guinea the islands of new zealand and the philippines some of these islands are structurally associated with nearby continents high islands are of volcanic origin and many contain active volcanoes among these are bougainville hawaii and the solomon islands 44 the coral reefs of the south pacific are low-lying structures that have built up on basaltic lava flows under the ocean s surface one of the most dramatic is the great barrier reef off northeastern australia with chains of reef patches a second island type formed of coral is the uplifted coral platform which is usually

volume of the pacific ocean representing about 50.1 percent of the world s oceanic water has been estimated at some 714 million cubic kilometers 171 million cubic miles  47 surface water temperatures in the pacific can vary from −1.4 °c 29.5 °f  the freezing point of sea water in the poleward areas to about 30 °c 86 °f near the equator 48 salinity also varies latitudinally reaching a maximum of 37 parts per thousand in the southeastern area the water near the equator which can have a salinity as low as 34 parts per thousand is less salty than that found in the mid-latitudes because of abundant equatorial precipitation throughout the year the lowest counts of less than 32 parts per thousand are found in the far north as less evaporation of seawater takes place in these frigid areas 49 the motion of pacific waters is generally clockwise in the northern hemisphere the north pacific gyre and counter-clockwise in the southern hemisphere the north equatorial current driven westward along latitude 15°n by the trade winds turns north near the philippines to become the warm japan or kuroshio current 50 turning eastward at about 45°n the kuroshio forks and some water moves northward as the aleutian current while the rest turns southward to rejoin the north equatorial current 51 the aleutian current branches as it approaches north america and forms the base of a counter-clockwise circulation in the bering sea its southern arm becomes the chilled slow south-flowing california current 52 the south equatorial current flowing west along the equator swings southward east of new guinea turns east at about 50°s and joins the main westerly circulation of the south pacific which includes the earth-circling antarctic circumpolar current as it approaches the chilean coast the south equatorial current divides one branch flows around cape horn and the other turns north to form the peru or humboldt current 53 climate edit impact of el niño and la niña on north america typhoon tip at global peak intensity on 12 october 1979 the climate patterns of the northern and southern hemispheres generally mirror each other the trade winds in the southern and eastern pacific are remarkably steady while conditions in the north pacific are far more varied with for example cold winter temperatures on the east coast of russia contrasting with the milder weather off british columbia during the winter months due to the preferred flow of ocean currents 54 in the tropical and subtropical pacific the el niño southern oscillation enso affects weather conditions to determine the phase of enso the most recent three-month sea surface temperature average for the area approximately 3,000 km 1,900 mi to the southeast of hawaii is computed and if the region is more than 0.5 °c 0.9 °f above or below normal for that period then an el niño or la niña is considered in progress 55 in the tropical western pacific the monsoon and the related wet season during the summer months contrast with dry winds in the winter which blow over the ocean from the asian landmass 56 worldwide tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer when the difference between temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest however each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns on a worldwide scale may is the least active month while september is the most active month november is the only month in which all the tropical cyclone basins are active 57 the pacific hosts the two most active tropical cyclone basins which are the northwestern pacific and the eastern pacific pacific hurricanes form south of mexico sometimes striking the western mexican coast and occasionally the southwestern united states between june and october while typhoons forming in the northwestern pacific moving into southeast and east asia from may to december tropical cyclones also form in the south pacific basin where they occasionally impact island nations in the arctic icing from october to may can present a hazard for shipping while persistent fog occurs from june to december 58 a climatological low in the gulf of alaska keeps the southern coast wet and mild during the winter months the westerlies and associated jet stream within the mid-latitudes can be particularly strong especially in the southern hemisphere due to the temperature difference between the tropics and antarctica 59 which records the coldest temperature readings on the planet in the southern hemisphere because of the stormy and cloudy conditions associated with extratropical cyclones riding the jet stream it is usual to refer to the westerlies as the roaring forties furious fifties and shrieking sixties according to the varying degrees of latitude 60 geology edit main articles geology of the

first mapped by abraham ortelius he called it maris pacifici following ferdinand magellan s description of it as a pacific sea during his circumnavigation from 1519 to 1522. to magellan it seemed much more calm pacific than the atlantic 61 the andesite line is the most significant regional distinction in the pacific a petrologic boundary it separates the deeper mafic igneous rock of the central pacific basin from the partially submerged continental areas of felsic igneous rock on its margins 62 the andesite line follows the western edge of the islands off california and passes south of the aleutian arc along the eastern edge of the kamchatka peninsula the kuril islands japan the mariana islands the solomon islands and new zealand s north island 63 64 the dissimilarity continues northeastward along the western edge of the andes cordillera along south america to mexico returning then to the islands off california indonesia the philippines japan new guinea and new zealand lie outside the andesite line within the closed loop of the andesite line are most of the deep troughs submerged volcanic mountains and oceanic volcanic islands that characterize the pacific basin here basaltic lavas gently flow out of rifts to build huge dome-shaped volcanic mountains whose eroded summits form island arcs chains and clusters outside the andesite line volcanism is of the explosive type and the pacific ring of fire is the world s foremost belt of explosive volcanism 40 the ring of fire is named after the several hundred active volcanoes that sit above the various subduction zones the pacific ocean is the only ocean which is almost totally bounded by subduction zones only the antarctic and australian coasts have no nearby subduction zones geological history edit the pacific ocean was born 750 million years ago at the breakup of rodinia although it is generally called the panthalassic ocean until the breakup of pangea about 200 million years ago 65 the oldest pacific ocean floor is only around 180 ma old with older crust subducted by now 66 seamount chains edit the pacific ocean contains several long seamount chains formed by hotspot volcanism these include the hawaiian–emperor seamount chain and the louisville ridge economy edit the exploitation of the pacific s mineral wealth is hampered by the ocean s great depths in shallow waters of the continental shelves off the coasts of australia and new zealand petroleum and natural gas are extracted and pearls are harvested along the coasts of australia japan papua new guinea nicaragua panama

temperate islands yield herring salmon sardines snapper swordfish and tuna as well as shellfish 68 overfishing has become a serious problem in some areas for example catches in the rich fishing grounds of the okhotsk sea off the russian coast have been reduced by at least half since the 1990s as a result of overfishing 69 environmental issues edit main article marine pollution see also great

between 1972 and 2012. 70 marine pollution is a generic term for the harmful entry into the ocean of chemicals or particles the main culprits are those using the rivers for disposing of their waste 71 the rivers then empty into the ocean often also bringing chemicals used as fertilizers in agriculture the excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone 72 marine debris also known as marine litter is human-created waste that has ended up floating in a lake sea ocean or waterway oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and
