part of their colonial lands in america 20 21 22 the dutch were the first to take possession 22 by june 3, 1631, the dutch had begun settling the delmarva peninsula by establishing the zwaanendael colony on the site of present-day lewes delaware 23 in 1638, sweden established the new sweden colony in the region of fort christina on the site of present-day wilmington delaware new sweden claimed and for the most part controlled the lower delaware river region parts of present-day delaware new jersey and pennsylvania but settled few colonists there 24 25 penn s treaty with the indians by edward hicks on march 12, 1664, king charles ii of england gave james duke of york a grant that incorporated all lands included in the original virginia company of plymouth grant plus other lands this grant was in conflict with the dutch claim for new netherland which included parts of today s pennsylvania 26 on june 24, 1664, the duke of york sold the portion of his large grant that included present-day new jersey to john berkeley and george carteret for a proprietary colony the land was not yet in british possession but the sale boxed in the portion of new netherland on the west side of the delaware river the british conquest of new netherland began on august 29, 1664, when new amsterdam was coerced to surrender while facing cannons on british ships in new york harbor 27 28 this

colony new amsterdam the dutch established three county courts which went on to become original counties in present-day delaware and pennsylvania the one that later transferred to pennsylvania was upland 31 this was partially reversed on february 9, 1674, when the treaty of westminster ended the third anglo-dutch war and reverted all political situations to the status quo ante bellum the british retained the dutch counties with their dutch names 32 by june 11, 1674, new york reasserted control over the outlying colonies including upland but the names started to be changed to british names by november 11, 1674. 33 upland was partitioned on november 12, 1674, producing the general outline of the current border between pennsylvania and delaware 34 on february 28, 1681, charles ii

largest land grants to an individual in history 38 the king named it pennsylvania literally penn s woods in honor of the admiral penn the son who wanted it to be called new wales and then sylvania from the latin silva forest woods  was embarrassed at the change fearing that people would think he had named it after himself but king charles would not rename the grant 39 penn established a government with two innovations that were much copied in the new world the county commission and freedom of religious conviction 38 a mapp of ye improved part of pensilvania in america divided into

and the indians 42 additional treaties between quakers and other tribes followed the treaty of william penn was never violated 43 18th century edit between 1730 and when it was shut down by parliament with the currency act of 1764, the pennsylvania colony made its own paper money to account for the shortage of actual gold and silver the paper money was called colonial scrip the colony issued bills of credit  which were as good as gold or silver coins because of their legal tender status since they were issued by the government and not a banking institution it was an interest-free proposition largely defraying the expense of the government and therefore taxation of the people it also promoted general employment and prosperity since the government used discretion and did not issue too much to inflate the currency benjamin franklin had a hand in creating this currency of which he said its utility was never to be disputed and it also met with the cautious approval of adam smith 44 james smith wrote that in 1763, the indians again commenced hostilities and were busily engaged in killing and scalping the frontier inhabitants in various parts of pennsylvania further this state was then a quaker government and at the first of this war the frontiers received no assistance from the state 45 the ensuing hostilities became known as pontiac s war president s house philadelphia  the masters-penn mansion housed pennsylvania s governor in the early 1770s it later served as the presidential mansion of george washington and john adams 1790–1800 while philadelphia was the temporary national capital after the stamp act congress of 1765, delegate john dickinson of philadelphia wrote the declaration of rights and grievances the congress was the first meeting of the thirteen colonies called at the request of the massachusetts assembly but only nine colonies sent delegates 46 dickinson then wrote letters from a farmer in pennsylvania to the inhabitants of the british colonies which were published in the pennsylvania chronicle between december 2, 1767, and february 15, 1768. 47 when the founding fathers of the united states convened in philadelphia in 1774, 12 colonies sent representatives to the first continental congress 48 the second continental congress which also met in philadelphia in may 1775  drew up and signed the declaration of independence in philadelphia 49 but when that city was captured by the british the continental congress escaped westward meeting at the lancaster courthouse on saturday september 27, 1777, and then to york there they and its primary author john dickinson drew up the articles of confederation that formed 13 independent colonies into a new nation later the constitution was written and philadelphia was once again chosen to be cradle to the new american nation 50 the constitution was drafted and signed at the pennsylvania state house now known as independence hall and the same building where the declaration of independence was signed 51 pennsylvania became the first large state and the second state to ratify the u.s constitution on december 12, 1787, 52 five days after delaware became the first at the time

from 1821 until it burned down in 1897. for half a century the commonwealth s general assembly legislature met at various places in the general philadelphia area before starting to meet regularly in independence hall in philadelphia for 63 years 54 but it needed a more central location as for example the paxton boys massacres of 1763 had made the legislature aware so in 1799 the general assembly moved to the lancaster courthouse 54 and finally in 1812 to harrisburg 54 19th century edit the general assembly met in the old dauphin county court house until december 1821, 54 when the federal-style hills capitol named for its builder stephen hills a lancaster architect was constructed on a hilltop land grant of four acres set aside for a seat of state government by the prescient entrepreneurial son and namesake of john harris sr. a yorkshire native who had founded a trading post in 1705 and ferry 1733 on the east shore of the susquehanna river 55 the hills capitol burned down on february 2, 1897, during a heavy snowstorm presumably because of a faulty flue 54 the general assembly met at grace methodist church on state street still standing until a new capitol could be built following an architectural selection contest that many alleged had been rigged  chicago architect henry ives cobb was charged with designing and building a replacement building however the legislature had little money to allocate to the project and a roughly finished somewhat industrial building the cobb capitol was completed the general assembly refused to occupy the building political and popular indignation in 1901 prompted a second contest that was restricted to pennsylvania architects and joseph miller huston of philadelphia was chosen to design the present pennsylvania state capitol that incorporated cobb s building into magnificent public work finished and dedicated in 1907. 54 the new state capitol drew rave reviews 54 its dome was inspired by the domes of st peter s basilica in rome and the united states capitol 54 president theodore roosevelt called it the most beautiful state capital in the nation and said it s the handsomest building i ever saw at the dedication in 1989, the new york times praised it as grand even awesome at moments but it is also a working building accessible to citizens . a building that connects with the reality of daily life
