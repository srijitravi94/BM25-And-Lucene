26,500 years ago 37 38 negritos were also among the archipelago s earliest inhabitants but their first settlement in the philippines has not been reliably dated 39 there are several opposing theories regarding the origins of ancient filipinos f landa jocano theorizes that the ancestors of the filipinos evolved locally wilhelm solheim s island origin theory 40 postulates that the peopling of the archipelago transpired via trade networks originating in the sundaland area around 48,000 to 5000 bc rather than by wide-scale migration the austronesian expansion theory explains that malayo-polynesians coming from taiwan began migrating to the philippines around 4000 bc displacing earlier arrivals 41 the most widely accepted theory based on linguistic and archeological evidence is the out-of-taiwan model which hypothesizes that austronesians from taiwan who were themselves descended from the neolithic civilizations of the yangtze river such as the liangzhu culture 42 began migrating to the philippines around 4000 bc displacing earlier arrivals 41 43 during the neolithic period a jade culture is said to have existed as evidenced by tens of thousands of exquisitely crafted jade artifacts found in the philippines dated to 2000 bc 44 45 the jade is said to have originated nearby in taiwan and is also found in many other areas in insular and mainland southeast asia these artifacts are said to be evidence of long range communication between prehistoric southeast asian societies 46 by 1000 bc the inhabitants of the archipelago had developed into four kinds of social groups hunter-gatherer tribes warrior societies highland plutocracies and port principalities 47 precolonial epoch further information history of the philippines 900–1521  religion in pre-colonial philippines and cultural achievements of pre-colonial philippines a boxer codex image illustrating the ancient kadatuan or tumao noble class  the current demarcation between the prehistory and the early history of the philippines is 21 april 900, which is the equivalent on the proleptic gregorian calendar for the date indicated on the laguna copperplate inscription—the earliest known surviving written record to come from the philippines 48 this date came in the middle of what anthropologists refer to as the philippines emergent phase 1st–14th centuries ce  which was characterized by newly emerging socio-cultural patterns the initial development of large coastal settlements greater social stratification and specialization and the beginnings of local and international trade 49 by the 1300s a number of the large coastal settlements had become progressive trading centers and became the focal point of societal changes ushering complex lifeways which characterized what f landa jocano called the barangic phase of early philippine history beginning from the 14th century through the arrival of spanish colonizers and the beginning of the philippines colonial period 49 the discovery of iron at around the 1st century ad created significant social and economic changes which allowed settlements to grow larger and develop new social patterns characterized by social stratification and specialization 49 some of these polities particularly the coastal settlements at or near the mouths of large rivers 50 eventually developed substantial trade contacts with the early trading powers of southeast asia most importantly the indianized kingdoms of malaysia and java the various dynasties of china 50 thailand 51 and later the muslim sultanate of brunei 52 they also traded with vietnam 51 japan 53 and other austronesian islands 54 based on archeological findings trade with china is believed to have begun in the tang dynasty but grew more extensive during the song dynasty 52 by the 2nd millennium ce some but not all philippine polities were known to have sent trade delegations which participated in the tributary system enforced by the chinese imperial court 52 these tributary states nominally acknowledged the sinocentric system which saw china and the imperial court as the cultural center of the world among the early philippine polities this arrangement fulfilled the requirements for trade with china but did not actually translate into political or military control 52 50 the ifugao igorot people utilized terrace farming in the steep mountainous regions of northern philippines over 2000 years ago regarding the relations of early philippine polities with the various state-level polities of indonesia and malaysia legendary accounts often mention the interaction of early philippine polities with the srivijaya empire but there is not much archeological evidence to definitively support such a relationship 49 considerable evidence exists on the other hand for extensive trade with the majapahit empire 55 the exact scope and mechanisms of indian cultural influences on early philippine polities are still the subject of some debate among southeast asian historiographers 49 56 but the current scholarly consensus is that there was probably little or no direct trade between india and the philippines 49 56 and indian cultural traits such as linguistic terms and religious practices 55 filtered in during the 10th through the early 14th centuries through early philippine polities relations with the hindu majapahit empire 49 the philippine archipelago is thus one of the countries others include afghanistan and southern vietnam just at the outer edge of what is considered the greater indian cultural zone  56 the early polities of the philippine archipelago were typically characterized by a three-tier social structure 49 50 although different cultures had different terms to describe them this three-tier structure invariably consisted of an apex nobility class a class of freemen  and a class of dependent debtor-bondsmen called alipin or oripun 49 50 among the members of the nobility class were leaders who held the political office of datu which was responsible for leading autonomous social groups called barangay or dulohan  49 whenever these barangays banded together either to form a larger settlement 49 or a geographically looser alliance group 50 the more senior or respected among them would be recognized as a paramount datu  variedly called a lakan sultan rajah or simply a more senior datu 52 49 57 early historic coastal polities the laguna copperplate inscription c 900. the oldest known historical record found in the philippines discovered at lumban laguna the earliest historical record of these kingdoms is the laguna copperplate inscription which indirectly refers to the tagalog settlement of tondo c before 900–1589 and two to three other settlements believed to be located somewhere near tondo as well as a settlement near mt diwata in mindanao and the temple complex of medang in java 48 although the precise political relationships between these polities is unclear in the text of the inscription the artifact is usually accepted as evidence of intra- and inter-regional political linkages as early as 900 ce 48 52 50 by the arrival of the earliest european ethnographers during the 1500s tondo was led by the paramount ruler called a lakan  52 50 it had grown into a major trading hub sharing a monopoly with the rajahnate of maynila over the trade of ming dynasty 58 products throughout the archipelago 52 this trade was significant enough that the yongle emperor appointed a chinese governor named ko ch a-lao to oversee it 59 60 the next historical record referred a location in the philippines is volume 186 of official history of the song dynasty which describes the country of ma-i c before 971 – after 1339  song dynasty traders visited ma-i annually and their accounts described ma-i s geography trade products and the trade behaviors of its rulers 61 because the descriptions of mai s location in these accounts are not clear there is some dispute about mai s possible location with some scholars believing it was located in bay laguna 62 and others believing it was on the island of mindoro 38 the butuan ivory seal c 1002 was recovered in the 1970s in butuan the official history of the song dynasty next refers to the rajahnate of butuan c before 1001–1756 in northeastern mindanao which is the first polity from the philippine archipelago recorded as having sent a tribute mission to the chinese empire – on march 17, 1001 ce butuan attained prominence under the rule of rajah sri bata shaja 54 who was from a buddhist ruling-class governing a hindu nation this state became powerful due to the local goldsmith industry and it also had commercial ties and a diplomatic rivalry with the champa civilization the kedatuan of madja-as c 1200–1569 was founded following a civil war in collapsing srivijaya wherein loyalists of the malay datus of srivijaya defied the invading chola dynasty and its puppet-rajah called makatunao and set up a guerrilla-state in the islands of the visayas its founding datu puti had purchased land for his new realms from the aboriginal ati hero marikudo 63 verification needed madja-as was founded on panay island named after the destroyed state of pannai allied under srivijaya which was located in sumatra  afterwards the people of madja-as often raided the port cities of southern china and warred with the chinese navy 64 the rajahnate of cebu 65 c 1200–1565 was a neighbor of madja-as in the visayas led by rajamuda sri lumay a monarch with partial tamil descent this state grew wealthy by making use of the inter-island shipping within the archipelago 66 both the rajahnates of butuan and cebu were allied to each other and they also maintained contact and had trade routes with kutai a hindu country 67 in south borneo established by indian traders 68 the earliest legendary date mentioning the rajahnate of maynila c 1258–1571 on the island of luzon across the pasig river from tondo has to do with the naval victory of the bruneian rajah ahmad over the majapahit rajah avirjirkaya who ruled a prior pre-muslim settlement in the same location 52 chinese records of this period also mention a polity called luzon this is believed to be a reference to maynila since portuguese and spanish accounts from the 1520s explicitly state that luçon and maynila were one and the same  52 although some historians argue that since none of these observers actually visited maynila luçon may simply have referred to all the tagalog and kapampangan polities that rose up on the shores of manila bay 69 either way from the early 1500s to as late as the 1560s this seafaring people was referred to in portuguese malacca as luções and they participated in trading ventures and military campaigns in myanmar malacca and east timor 70 71 72 where they were employed as traders and mercenaries 73 74 75 in northern luzon the wangdom of pangasinan c 1406–1576 sent emissaries to china in

syed abu bakr an arab trader born in johore arrived in sulu from malacca and established the sultanate of sulu by converting sulu s rajah rajah baguinda ali and marrying his daughter 77 78 at the end of the 15th century shariff mohammed kabungsuwan of johor introduced islam in the island of mindanao and established the sultanate of maguindanao the sultanate form of government extended further into lanao 79 islam then started to spread out of mindanao in the south and went into luzon in the north manila in luzon was islamized during the reign of sultan bolkiah in 1485 to 1521. this was accomplished because the sultanate of brunei subjugated tondo by defeating rajah gambang in battle and thereafter installing the muslim rajah rajah salalila to the throne and by establishing the bruneian puppet-state of the rajahnate of maynila 80 81 82 83 sultan bolkiah also married laila mecana the daughter of sulu sultan amir ul-ombra to expand brunei s influence in both luzon and mindanao 84 the muslims then proceeded to wage wars and conduct slave-raids against the visayans 85 participating in the muslim raids the sultanate of ternate consequently destroyed the kedatuan of dapitan in bohol 86 the rajahnates of butuan and cebu also endured slave raids from and waged wars against the sultanate of maguindanao 87 the rivalries between the datus rajahs sultans and lakans eventually eased spanish colonization furthermore the islands were sparsely populated 88 due to consistent natural disasters 89 and inter-kingdom conflicts therefore colonization was made easy and the small states of the archipelago quickly became incorporated into the spanish empire and were hispanicized and christianized 90 colonial era spanish rule further information history of the philippines

warlord limahong 94 95 to counteract the islamization of the philippines the spanish then conducted the castilian war which was aimed against the sultanate of brunei 96 97 and war was also waged against the sultanate of ternate and tidore in response to ternatean slaving and piracy against spain s allies bohol and butuan  98 the spanish considered their war with the muslims in southeast asia an extension of the reconquista a centuries-long campaign to retake and rechristianize the spanish homeland which was invaded by the muslims of the umayyad caliphate the spanish expeditions into the philippines were also part of a larger ibero-islamic world conflict 99 that included a rivalry with the ottoman caliphate which had a center of operations at its nearby vassal the sultanate of aceh 100 consequently fortifications were also set up in taiwan and the maluku islands these were abandoned and the spanish soldiers along with the newly christianized papuan natives of the moluccas withdrew back to the philippines in order to re-concentrate their military forces because of a threatened invasion by the japan-born ming-dynasty loyalist koxinga ruler of the kingdom of tungning 101 however the planned invasion was aborted meanwhile settlers were sent to the pacific islands of palau and the marianas 102 spanish rule eventually contributed significantly to bringing political unity

they also founded schools a university hospitals and churches which were built along the earthquake baroque architectural style 110 to defend their settlements the spaniards constructed and manned a network of military fortresses called presidios across the archipelago 111 the spanish also decreed the introduction of free public schooling in 1863. 112 as a result of these policies the philippine population increased exponentially 113 114 during its rule spain quelled various indigenous revolts there were also several external military challenges from chinese and japanese pirates the dutch the english the portuguese and the muslims of southeast asia those challengers were fought off despite the hostile forces having encircled the philippine archipelago in a crescent formed from japan to

precursor to the philippine revolution 90 119 120 121 revolutionary sentiments were stoked in 1872 after three priests—mariano gómez josé burgos and jacinto zamora collectively known as gomburza —were accused of sedition by colonial authorities and executed 119 120 this would inspire a propaganda movement in spain organized by marcelo h del pilar josé rizal and mariano ponce lobbying for political reforms in the philippines rizal was eventually executed on december 30, 1896, on charges of rebellion 122 as attempts at reform met with resistance andrés bonifacio in 1892 established the secret society called the katipunan who sought independence from spain through armed revolt 121 bonifacio and the katipunan started the philippine revolution in 1896. a faction of the katipunan the magdalo
