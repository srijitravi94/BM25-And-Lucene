claims french empire 1669–1758 british empire 1681–1781 united states 1776–present pittsburgh was named in 1758 by general john forbes in honor of british statesman william pitt 1st earl of chatham the original pronunciation would have been ˈpɪtsbrə -bərə pits-brə or pits-bə-rə matching similarly named places in great britain such as edinburgh in scotland and aldeburgh in suffolk 19 pittsburgh was incorporated as a township in 1771 and as a borough on april 22, 1794, with the following act 20 be it enacted by the pennsylvania state senate and pennsylvania house of representatives of the commonwealth of pennsylvania...by the authority of the same that the said town of pittsburgh shall be...erected into a borough which shall be called the borough of pittsburgh for ever 21 the current pronunciation which is extremely unusual in english speaking countries is almost certainly a result of a printing error in some copies of the city charter of march 18, 1816 though not on the original document  the error was repeated commonly enough throughout the rest of the 19th century that the original pronunciation was lost and in 1890 the h was removed in order to make it easier to spell after a public campaign the original spelling was officially restored by the united states board on geographic names in 1911. 21 the area of the ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the shawnee and several other settled groups of native americans 22 the first known european to enter the region was the french explorer trader robert de la salle from quebec during his 1669 expedition down the ohio

disease spread into other areas infected other tribes and killed hundreds of thousands 27 28 not in citation given during this period the powerful nations of the iroquois confederacy based in new york had maintained control of much of the ohio valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes by the terms of the 1768 treaty of fort stanwix the penns were allowed to

particle pollution than pittsburgh for ozone smog pollution pittsburgh was ranked 24th among u.s metro areas 66 67 the area has improved its air quality with every annual survey the ala s rankings have been disputed by the allegheny county health department achd  since data from only the worst of the region s 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ala without any context or averaging the
