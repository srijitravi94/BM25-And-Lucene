a portuguese-speaking person or nation may be referred to as lusophone in both english and portuguese portuguese is part of the ibero-romance group that evolved from several dialects of vulgar latin in the medieval kingdom of galicia and has kept some celtic phonology and lexicon 7 8 with approximately 215 to 220 million native speakers and 260 million total speakers portuguese is usually listed as the sixth most natively spoken language in the world the third-most spoken european language in the world in terms of native speakers 9 and a major language of the southern hemisphere it is also the most spoken language in south america and the second-most spoken in latin america after spanish and is an official language of the european union mercosul oas ecowas and the african union history edit main article history of the portuguese language when the romans arrived in the iberian peninsula in 216 b.c. they brought the latin language with them from which all romance languages descend the language was spread by roman soldiers settlers and merchants who built roman cities mostly near the settlements of previous celtic or celtiberian civilizations established long before the roman arrivals between 409 a.d and 711 a.d. as the roman empire collapsed in western europe the iberian peninsula was conquered by germanic peoples of the migration period the occupiers mainly suebi 10 11 and visigoths who originally spoke germanic languages quickly adopted late roman culture and the vulgar latin dialects of the peninsula and over the next 300 years totally integrated into the local populations after the moorish invasion beginning in 711, arabic became the administrative and common language in the conquered regions but most of the remaining christian population continued to speak a form of romance commonly known as mozarabic which lasted three centuries longer in spain portuguese evolved from the medieval language known today by linguists as galician-portuguese old portuguese or old galician of the northwestern medieval kingdom of galicia it is in latin administrative documents of the 9th century that written galician-portuguese words and phrases are first recorded this phase is known as proto-portuguese which lasted from the 9th century until the 12th-century independence of the county of portugal from the kingdom of león by then reigning over galicia in the first part of the galician-portuguese period from the 12th to the 14th century  the language was increasingly used for documents and other written forms for some time it was the language of preference for lyric poetry in christian hispania much as occitan was the language of the poetry of the troubadours in france portugal became an independent kingdom in 1139, under king afonso i of portugal in 1290, king denis of portugal created the first portuguese university in lisbon the estudos gerais which later moved to coimbra and decreed for portuguese then simply called the common language  to be known as the portuguese language and used officially in the second period of old portuguese in the 15th and 16th centuries with the portuguese discoveries the language was taken to many regions of africa asia and the americas by the mid-16th century portuguese had become a lingua franca in asia and africa used not only for colonial administration and trade but also for communication between local officials and europeans of all nationalities its spread was helped by mixed marriages between portuguese and local people and by its association with roman catholic missionary efforts which led to the formation of creole languages such as that called kristang in many parts of asia from the word cristão christian  the language continued to be popular in parts of asia until the 19th century some portuguese-speaking christian communities in india sri lanka malaysia and indonesia preserved their language even after they were isolated from portugal the end of the old portuguese period was marked by the publication of the cancioneiro geral by garcia de resende in 1516. the early times of modern portuguese which spans the period from the 16th century to the present day were characterized by an increase in the number of learned words borrowed from classical latin and classical greek because of the renaissance which greatly enriched the lexicon most literate portuguese speakers were also literate in latin and thus they easily adopted latin words into their writing—and eventually speech—in portuguese citation needed spanish author miguel de cervantes once called portuguese the sweet and gracious language  while the brazilian poet olavo bilac described it as a última flor do lácio inculta e bela the last flower of latium rustic and beautiful  portuguese is also termed the language

inhabitants this number does not include the lusophone diaspora estimated at approximately 10 million people including 4.5 million portuguese 3 million brazilians and half a million cape verdeans among others  although it is hard to obtain official accurate numbers of diasporic portuguese speakers because a significant portion of these citizens are naturalized citizens born outside of lusophone territory or are children of immigrants and may have only a basic command of the language it is also important to note that a large part of the diaspora is a part of the already-counted population of the portuguese-speaking countries and territories such as the high number of brazilian and palop emigrant citizens in portugal or the high number of portuguese emigrant citizens in the palop and brazil the portuguese language therefore serves more than 250 million people daily who have direct or indirect legal juridical and social contact with it varying from the only language used

economic community of mercosul with other south american nations namely argentina uruguay and paraguay portuguese is either mandatory or taught in the schools of those south american countries although early in the 21st century after macau was ceded to china and brazilian immigration to japan slowed down the use of portuguese was in decline in asia it is once again becoming a language of opportunity there mostly because of increased diplomatic and financial ties with economically powerful portuguese-speaking countries brazil angola mozambique etc in the world 55 dialects edit main articles portuguese dialects and portuguese in the americas ethnically diverse east timor has portuguese as one of its official languages você is used for educated formal and colloquial respectful speech in most portuguese-speaking regions in the brazilian state of rio grande do sul você is virtually absent from the spoken language in portugal it may be considered disrespectful to treat a stranger as você so the pronoun is either replaced by the name of the person or a title or it is omitted since the verbal conjugation allows the distinction between formal and informal treatment riograndense or gaúcho portuguese normally distinguishes formal from informal speech by verbal conjugation informal speech employs tu followed by third person verbs formal language retains the traditional second person conjugation of tu has three different forms in brazil verb to see tu viste  in the traditional second person tu viu  in the third person and tu visse  in the innovative second person  the conjugation used in the brazilian states of pará santa catarina and maranhão being generally traditional second person the kind that is used in other portuguese-speaking countries and learned in brazilian schools the predominance of southeastern-based media products has established você as the pronoun of choice for the second person singular in both writing and multimedia communications however in the city of rio de janeiro the country s main cultural centre the usage of tu has been expanding ever since the end of the 20th century see 56 a linguistic research on the topic in portuguese  being most frequent among youngsters and a number of studies have also shown an increase in its use in a number of other brazilian dialects 57 58 the status of second person pronouns in brazil red indicates near exclusive use of você mauve indicates decidedly predominant use of tu but with near exclusive third person você-like verbal conjugation brown indicates 50-50 tu

spoken in the area including and surrounding the cities of coimbra and lisbon in central portugal standard european portuguese is also the preferred standard by the portuguese-speaking african countries as such and despite the fact that its speakers are dispersed around the world portuguese has only two dialects used for learning the european and the brazilian some aspects and sounds found in many dialects of brazil are exclusive to south america and cannot be found in europe however the santomean portuguese in africa may be confused with a brazilian dialect by its phonology and prosody audio samples of some dialects and accents of portuguese are available below 59 there are some differences between the areas but these are the best approximations possible ipa transcriptions refer to the names in local pronunciation brazil edit caipira — spoken in the states of são paulo most markedly on the countryside and rural areas southern minas gerais northern paraná and southeastern mato grosso do sul depending on the vision of what constitutes caipira triângulo mineiro border areas of goiás and the remaining parts of mato grosso do sul are included and the frontier of caipira in minas gerais is expanded further northerly though not reaching metropolitan belo horizonte it is often said that caipira appeared by decreolization of the língua brasílica and the related língua geral paulista then spoken in almost all of what is now são paulo a former lingua franca in most of the contemporary centro-sul of brazil before the 18th century brought by the bandeirantes interior pioneers of colonial brazil closely related to its northern counterpart nheengatu and that is why the dialect shows many general differences from other variants of the language 60 it has striking remarkable differences in comparison to other brazilian dialects in phonology prosody and grammar often stigmatized as being strongly associated with a substandard variant now mostly rural 61 62 63 64 65 cearense or costa norte — is a dialect spoken more sharply in the states of ceará and piauí the variant of ceará includes fairly distinctive traits it shares with the one spoken in piauí though such as distinctive regional phonology and vocabulary for example a debuccalization process stronger than that of portuguese a different system of the vowel harmony that spans brazil from fluminense and mineiro to amazofonia but is especially prevalent in nordestino a very coherent coda sibilant palatalization as those of portugal and rio de janeiro but allowed in fewer environments than in other accents of nordestino a greater presence of dental stop palatalization to palato-alveolar in comparison to other accents of nordestino among others as well as a great number of archaic portuguese words  66 67 68 69 70 71 baiano — found in bahia sergipe northern minas gerais and border regions with goiás and tocantins similar to nordestino it has a very characteristic syllable-timed rhythm and the greatest tendency to pronounce unstressed vowels as open-mid ɛ and ɔ  variants and sociolects of brazilian portuguese fluminense — a broad dialect with many variants spoken in the states of rio de janeiro espírito santo and neighbouring eastern regions of minas gerais fluminense formed in these previously caipira-speaking areas due to the gradual influence of european migrants causing many people to distance their speech from their original dialect and incorporate new terms 72 fluminense is sometimes referred to as carioca however carioca is a more specific term referring to the accent of the greater rio de janeiro area by speakers with a fluminense dialect gaúcho — in rio grande do sul similar to sulista there are many distinct accents in rio grande do sul mainly due to the heavy influx of european immigrants of diverse origins who have settled in colonies throughout the state and to the proximity to spanish-speaking nations the gaúcho word in itself is a spanish loanword into portuguese of obscure indigenous amerindian origins percentage of worldwide portuguese speakers per country mineiro — minas gerais not prevalent in the triângulo mineiro  as the fluminense area its associated region was formerly a sparsely populated land where caipira was spoken but the discovery of gold and gems made it the most prosperous brazilian region what attracted portuguese colonists commoners from other parts of brazil and their african slaves south-southwestern southeastern and northern areas of the state have fairly distinctive speech actually approximating to caipira fluminense popularly called often pejoratively carioca do brejo marsh carioca and baiano respectively areas including and surrounding belo horizonte have a distinctive accent nordestino 73 — more marked in the sertão 7  where in the 19th and 20th centuries and especially in the area including and surrounding the sertão the dry land after agreste of pernambuco and southern ceará it could sound less comprehensible to speakers of other portuguese dialects than galician or rioplatense spanish and nowadays less distinctive from other variants in the metropolitan cities along the coasts it can be divided in two regional variants one that includes the northern maranhão and southern of piauí and other that goes from ceará to alagoas nortista or amazofonia — most of amazon basin states i.e northern brazil before the 20th century most people from the nordestino area fleeing the droughts and their associated poverty settled here so it has some similarities with the portuguese dialect there spoken the speech in and around the cities of belém and manaus has a more european flavor in phonology prosody and grammar paulistano — variants spoken around greater são paulo in its maximum definition and more easterly areas of são paulo state as well perhaps educated speech from anywhere in the state of são paulo where it coexists with caipira  caipira is the hinterland sociolect of much of the central-southern half of brazil nowadays conservative only in the rural areas and associated with them that has a historically low prestige in cities as rio de janeiro curitiba belo horizonte and until some years ago in são paulo itself sociolinguistics or what by times is described as linguistic prejudice  often correlated with classism 74 75 76 is a polemic topic in the entirety of the country since the times of adoniran barbosa also the paulistano accent was heavily influenced by the presence of immigrants in the city of são paulo especially the italians sertanejo — center-western states and also much of tocantins and rondônia it is closer to mineiro caipira nordestino or nortista depending on the location sulista — the variants spoken in the areas between the northern regions of rio grande do sul and southern regions of são paulo state encompassing most of southern brazil the city of curitiba does have a fairly distinct accent as well and a relative majority of speakers around and in florianópolis also speak this variant many speak florianopolitano or manezinho da ilha instead related to the european portuguese dialects spoken in azores and madeira  speech of northern paraná is closer to that of inland são paulo florianopolitano — variants heavily influenced by european portuguese spoken in florianópolis city due to a heavy immigration movement from portugal mainly its insular regions and much of its metropolitan area grande florianópolis said to be a continuum between those whose speech most resemble sulista dialects and those whose speech most resemble fluminense and european ones called often pejoratively manezinho da ilha carioca — not a dialect but sociolects of the fluminense variant spoken in an area roughly corresponding to greater rio de janeiro it appeared after locals came in contact with the portuguese aristocracy amidst the portuguese royal family fled in the early 19th century there is actually a continuum between vernacular countryside accents and the carioca sociolect and the educated speech in portuguese norma culta which most closely resembles other brazilian portuguese standards but with marked recent portuguese influences the nearest ones among the country s dialects along florianopolitano  so that not all people native to the state of rio de janeiro speak the said sociolect but most carioca speakers will use the standard variant not influenced by it that is rather uniform around brazil depending on context emphasis or formality for example  brasiliense — used in brasília and its metropolitan area 77 it is not considered a dialect but more of a regional variant – often deemed to be closer to fluminense than the dialect commonly spoken in most of goiás sertanejo arco do desflorestamento or serra amazônica — known in its region as the accent of the migrants  it has similarities with caipira sertanejo and often sulista that make it differing from amazofonia in the opposite group of brazilian dialects in which it is placed along nordestino baiano mineiro and fluminense  it is the most recent dialect which appeared by the settlement of families from various other brazilian regions attracted by the cheap land offer in recently deforested areas 78 79 recifense — used in recife and its metropolitan area portugal edit dialects of portuguese in portugal micaelense

portuguese and other varieties sometimes controversially deemed as separate languages such as galician and fala uruguay—dialectos portugueses del uruguay dpu differences between dialects are mostly of accent and vocabulary but between the brazilian dialects and other dialects especially in their most colloquial forms there can also be some grammatical differences the portuguese-based creoles spoken in various parts of africa asia and the americas are independent languages characterization and peculiarities edit portuguese like catalan preserved the stressed vowels of vulgar latin which became diphthongs in most other romance languages cf port. cat. sard pedra fr pierre sp piedra it pietra ro piatră from lat petra stone or port fogo cat foc sard fogu sp fuego it fuoco fr feu ro foc from lat focus fire  another characteristic of early portuguese was the loss of intervocalic l and n sometimes followed by the merger of the two surrounding vowels or by the insertion of an epenthetic vowel between them cf lat salire to jump  tenere to hold  catena chain  sp salir tener cadena port sair ter cadeia this characteristic happens today in celtic languages such as irish and scottish gaelic 80 when the elided consonant was n it often nasalized the preceding vowel cf lat manum hand  ranam frog  bonum good  port mão rãa bõo now mão rã bom  this process was the source of most of the language s distinctive nasal diphthongs in particular the latin endings -anem -anum and -onem became -ão in most cases cf lat canis dog  germanus brother  ratio reason with modern port cão irmão razão and their plurals -anes -anos -ones normally became -ães -ãos -ões cf cães irmãos razões this nasalisation could be an ancient proto-celtic characteristic which also exists today in breton and gaelic 81 the portuguese language is also the only romance language that has preserved the clitic case mesoclisis cf dar-te-ei i ll give thee  amar-te-ei i ll love you  contactá-los-ei i ll contact them  it was also the only western romance language to retain the latin synthetic pluperfect tense eu estivera i had been  eu vivera i had lived  vós vivêreis you had lived 82  romanian also has this tense but uses the -s- form vocabulary edit main article portuguese vocabulary the national library of brazil in rio de janeiro the largest library in latin america baroque library of the coimbra university portugal the royal portuguese reading room in rio de janeiro brazil a sign in the museum of macau most of the lexicon of portuguese is derived directly or through other romance languages from latin nevertheless because of its original celtiberian heritage and later the participation of portugal in the age of discovery it has some gallaecian words and adopted loanwords from all over the world a number of portuguese words can still be traced to the pre-roman inhabitants of portugal which included the gallaeci lusitanians celtici and cynetes most of these words derived from celtic and are very often shared with galician since both languages share a common origin in the medieval language of galician-portuguese a few of these words existed in latin as loanwords from a celtic source often gaulish altogether these are over 1,000 words some verbs and toponymic names of towns rivers utensils and plants in the 5th century the iberian peninsula the roman hispania was conquered by the germanic suebi and visigoths as they adopted the roman civilization and language however these people contributed with some 500 germanic words to the lexicon many of these words are related to warfare—such as espora spur  estaca stake  and guerra war  from gothic spaúra stakka and wirro respectively the germanic languages influence also exists in toponymic surnames and patronymic surnames borne by visigoth sovereigns and their descendants and it dwells on placenames such has ermesinde esposende and resende where sinde and sende are derived from the germanic sinths military expedition and in the case of resende the prefix re comes from germanic reths council  other examples of portuguese names surnames and town names of germanic toponymic origin include henrique henriques vermoim mandim calquim baguim gemunde guetim sermonde and many more are quite common mainly in the old suebi and later visigothic dominated regions covering today s northern half of portugal and galicia between the 9th and early 13th centuries portuguese acquired nearly 800 words from arabic by influence of moorish iberia they are often recognizable by the initial arabic article a l - and include many common words such as aldeia village from الضيعة alḍai`a or from edictum rothari aldii aldias  83 alface lettuce from الخس alkhass armazém warehouse from المخزن almakhzan and azeite olive oil from الزيت azzait starting in the 15th century the portuguese maritime explorations led to the introduction of many loanwords from asian languages for instance catana cutlass from japanese katana and chá tea from chinese chá from the 16th to the 19th centuries because of the role of portugal as intermediary in the atlantic slave trade and the establishment of large portuguese colonies in angola mozambique and brazil portuguese acquired several words of african and amerind origin especially names for most of the animals and plants found in those territories while those terms are mostly used in the former colonies many became current in european portuguese as well from kimbundu for example came kifumate cafuné head caress brazil  kusula caçula youngest child brazil  marimbondo tropical wasp brazil  and kubungula bungular to dance like a wizard angola  from south america came batata potato  from taino ananás and abacaxi from tupi–guarani naná and tupi ibá cati respectively two species of pineapple  and pipoca popcorn from tupi and tucano toucan from guarani tucan finally it has received a steady influx of loanwords from other european languages especially french and english these are by far the most important languages when referring to loanwords there are many examples such as colchete crochê bracket crochet  paletó jacket  batom lipstick  and filé filete steak slice  rua street respectively from french crochet paletot bâton filet rue and bife steak  futebol revólver stock estoque folclore from english beef football revolver stock folklore examples from other european languages macarrão pasta  piloto pilot  carroça carriage  and barraca barrack  from italian maccherone pilota carrozza and baracca melena hair lock  fiambre wet-cured ham in portugal in contrast with presunto dry-cured ham from latin prae-exsuctus dehydrated or canned ham in brazil in contrast with non-canned wet-cured presunto cozido and dry-cured presunto cru  and castelhano castilian  from spanish melena mane  fiambre and castellano before the last four decades brazilians adopted a greater number of loanwords from japanese and other european languages due to the historical immigration affecting their demographics  and they were and are also more willing to adopt foreign terms that come from globalization than the portuguese while the degree of african tupian and other amerindian lexicon in brazilian portuguese is shown to be surprisingly lesser than that commonly expected of the said variant by the local africanist and indianist academia that also has to some degree influenced the common sense of what gives a different cultural identity of brazilians in relation to the portuguese  so that its lexicon is almost identical about 99 to that of european portuguese 84 85 86 many portuguese settlers to colonial brazil were from northern and insular portugal 87 apart from some historically important illegal immigrants from elsewhere in europe such as galicia france and the netherlands 88 it should be noted that brazil received more european immigrants in its colonial history than the united states between 1500 and 1760, 700,000 europeans overwhelmingly portuguese settled in brazil while 530,000 europeans settled in the united states for the same given time 89 classification and related languages edit map showing the historical retreat

those romance languages and vice versa however portuguese and galician are mutually intelligible given that portuguese has a larger phonemic inventory than spanish portuguese is only moderately intelligible to some spanish speakers despite the strong lexical and grammatical similarity 89 between the two 90 91 92 93 portunhol a form of code-switching has a more lively use and is more readily mentioned in popular culture in south america said code-switching is not to be confused with the portunhol spoken on the borders of brazil with uruguay dialeto do pampa and paraguay dialeto dos brasiguaios  and of portugal with spain barranquenho  that are portuguese dialects spoken natively by thousands of people which have been heavily influenced by spanish 94 portuguese and spanish are the only ibero-romance languages and perhaps the only romance languages with such thriving inter-language forms in which visible and lively bilingual contact dialects and code-switching have formed in which functional bilingual communication is achieved through attempting an approximation to the target foreign language known as portunhol without a learned acquisition process but nevertheless facilitates communication there is an emerging literature focused on such phenomena including informal attempts of standardization of the linguistic continua and their usage  94 galician-portuguese in spain edit see also reintegrationism the closest relative of portuguese is galician which is spoken in the autonomous community region of galicia northwestern spain  the two were at one time a single language known today as galician-portuguese but they have diverged especially in pronunciation and vocabulary due to the political separation of portugal from galicia there is however still a linguistic continuity consisting of the variant of galician referred to as galego-português baixo-limiao which is spoken in several galician villages between the municipalities of entrimo and lobios and the transborder region of the natural park of peneda-gerês xurês it is considered a rarity a living vestige of the medieval language that ranged from cantabria to mondego .  95 as reported by unesco due to the pressure of the spanish language on the standard official version of the galician language the galician language was on the verge of disappearing 95 according to the unesco philologist tapani salminen the proximity to portuguese protects galician 96 nevertheless the core vocabulary and grammar of galician are still noticeably closer to portuguese than to those of spanish in particular like portuguese it uses the future subjunctive the personal infinitive and the synthetic pluperfect mutual intelligibility estimated at 90 by r a hall jr. 1989 97 is excellent between galicians and northern portuguese many linguists consider galician to be a co-dialect of the portuguese language another member of the galician-portuguese group most commonly thought of as a galician dialect is spoken in the eonavian region in a western strip in asturias and the westernmost parts of the provinces of león and zamora along the frontier with galicia between the eo and navia rivers or more exactly eo and frexulfe rivers  it is called eonaviego or gallego-asturiano by its speakers the fala language known by its speakers as xalimés mañegu a fala de xálima and chapurráu and in portuguese as a fala de xálima a fala da estremadura o galego da estremadura valego ou galaico-estremenho is another descendant of galician-portuguese spoken by a small number of people in the spanish towns of valverde del fresno valverdi du fresnu  eljas as ellas and san martín de trevejo sa martín de trevellu in the autonomous community of extremadura near the border with portugal there are a number of other places in spain in which the native language of the common people is a descendant of the galician-portuguese group such as la alamedilla cedillo cedilho  herrera de alcántara ferreira d alcântara and olivenza olivença  but in these municipalities what is spoken is actually portuguese not disputed as such in the mainstream it should be noticed that the diversity of dialects of the portuguese language is known since the time of medieval portuguese-galician language when it coexisted with the lusitanian-mozarabic dialect spoken in the south of portugal the dialectal diversity becomes more evident in the work of fernão d oliveira in the grammatica da lingoagem portuguesa 1536  where he remarks that the people of portuguese regions of beira alentejo estremadura and entre douro e minho all speak differently from each other also contador d argote 1725 distinguishes three main varieties of dialects the local dialects the dialects of time and of profession work jargon  of local dialects he highlights five main dialects the dialect of estremadura of entre-douro e minho of beira of algarve and of trás-os-montes he also makes reference to the overseas dialects the rustic dialects the poetic dialect and that of prose 98 in the kingdom of portugal ladinho or lingoagem ladinha was the name given to the pure portuguese language romance without any mixture of aravia or gerigonça judenga 99 while the term língua vulgar was used to name the language before d dinis decided to call it portuguese language  100 the erudite version used and known as galician-portuguese the language of the portuguese court and all other portuguese dialects were spoken at the same time in a historical perspective the portuguese language was never just one dialect just like today there is a standard portuguese actually two among the several dialects of portuguese in the past there was galician-portuguese as the standard  coexisting with other dialects influence on other languages edit

missionary activity in japan building on the work of earlier portuguese missionaries the dictionarium anamiticum lusitanum et latinum annamite–portuguese–latin dictionary of alexandre de rhodes 1651 introduced the modern orthography of vietnamese which is based on the orthography of 17th-century portuguese the romanization of chinese was also influenced by the portuguese language among others  particularly regarding chinese surnames one example is mei during 1583–88 italian jesuits michele ruggieri and matteo ricci created a portuguese–chinese dictionary—the first ever european–chinese dictionary 101 102 for instance as portuguese merchants were presumably the first to introduce the sweet orange in europe in several modern indo-european languages the fruit has been named after them

or purtuallo literally the portuguese one  in contrast to standard italian arancia derived languages edit main article portuguese-based creole languages beginning in the 16th century the extensive contacts between portuguese travelers and settlers african and asian slaves and local populations led to the appearance of many pidgins with varying amounts of portuguese influence as each of these pidgins became the mother tongue of succeeding generations they evolved into fully fledged creole languages which remained in use in many parts of asia africa and south america until the 18th century some portuguese-based or portuguese-influenced creoles are still spoken today by over 3 million people worldwide especially people of partial portuguese ancestry phonology edit main article portuguese phonology portuguese phonology is similar to those of languages such as french especially that of quebec  the gallo-italic languages occitan catalan and franco-provençal unlike that of spanish which is similar to those of sardinian and the southern italian dialects some would describe the phonology of portuguese as a blend of spanish gallo-romance e.g french and the languages of northern italy especially genoese  but with a deeper celtic influence 105 there is a maximum of 9 oral vowels 2 semivowels and 21 consonants though some varieties of the language have fewer phonemes there are also five nasal vowels which some linguists regard as allophones of the oral vowels vowels edit chart of monophthongs of the portuguese of lisbon with its ɐ ɐ̃ in central schwa position like catalan and

phonologists discuss whether their nature is vowel or consonant 111 in most of brazil and angola the consonant hereafter denoted as ɲ is realized as a nasal palatal approximant j̃  which nasalizes the vowel that precedes it ˈnĩj̃u  112 113 bisol 2005 122 proposes that portuguese possesses labio-velar stops kʷ and ɡʷ as additional phonemes rather than sequences of a velar stop and w  109 the consonant hereafter denoted as ʁ has a variety of realizations depending on dialect in europe it is typically a uvular trill ʀ however a pronunciation as a voiced uvular fricative ʁ may be becoming dominant in urban areas there is also a realization as a voiceless uvular fricative χ  and the original pronunciation as an alveolar trill r also remains very common in various dialects 114 a common realization of the word-initial r in the lisbon accent is a voiced uvular trill fricative ʀ̝  115 in brazil ʁ can be velar uvular or glottal and may be voiceless unless between voiced sounds 116 it is usually pronounced as a voiceless velar fricative x  a voiceless glottal fricative h or voiceless uvular fricative χ  see also guttural r in portuguese s and z are normally lamino-alveolar as in english however a number of dialects in northern portugal pronounce s and z as apico-alveolar sibilants sounding somewhat like a soft ʃ or ʒ  as in the romance languages of northern iberia a very few northeastern portugal dialects still maintain the medieval distinction between apical and laminal sibilants written s ss and c ç z respectively  as a phoneme tʃ only occurs in loanwords with a tendency for speakers to substitute in ʃ  however tʃ is an allophone of t before i in a number of brazilian dialects similarly dʒ is an allophone of d in the same contexts in northern and central portugal the voiced stops b  d  ɡ are usually lenited to fricatives β  ð  and ɣ respectively except at the beginning of words or after nasal vowels 117 118 a similar process occurs in spanish grammar edit main article portuguese grammar a notable aspect of the grammar of portuguese is the verb morphologically more verbal inflections from classical latin have been preserved by portuguese than by any other major romance language the portuguese and spanish grammars are very close it also has some innovations not found in other romance languages except galician and the fala the present perfect has an iterative sense unique to the galician-portuguese language group it denotes an action or a series of actions that began in the past and are expected to keep repeating in the future for instance the sentence tenho tentado falar com ela would be translated to i have been trying to talk to her  not i have tried to talk to her  on the other hand the correct translation of the question have you heard the latest news is not tem ouvido a última notícia  but ouviu a última notícia  since no repetition is implied 119 vernacular portuguese still uses the future subjunctive mood which developed from medieval west iberian romance and in present-day spanish and galician has almost entirely fallen into disuse the future subjunctive appears in dependent clauses that denote a condition that must be fulfilled in the future so that the independent clause will occur english normally employs the present tense under the same circumstances se eu for eleito presidente mudarei a lei if i should be elected president i will change the law quando fores mais velho vais entender when you grow older you will understand the personal infinitive infinitives can inflect according to their subject in person and number often showing who is expected to perform a certain action cf é melhor voltares it is better for you to go back  é melhor voltarmos it is better for us to go back perhaps for this reason infinitive clauses replace subjunctive clauses more often in portuguese than in other romance languages writing system edit written varieties portugal and non-1990 agreement countries brazil
