maya and inca which left behind abundant archeological and physical evidence of their societies scant artifacts and evidence remain of the puerto rico s indigenous population scarce archaeological findings and early spanish accounts from the colonial era constitute all that is known about them the first comprehensive book on the history of puerto rico was written by fray íñigo abbad y lasierra in 1786, nearly three centuries after the first spaniards landed on the island 40 the first known settlers were the ortoiroid people an archaic period culture of amerindian hunters and fishermen who migrated from the south american mainland some scholars suggest their settlement dates back about 4,000 years 41 an archeological dig in 1990 on the island of vieques found the remains of a man designated as the puerto ferro man  which was dated to around 2000 bc 42 the ortoiroid were displaced by the saladoid a culture from the same region that arrived on the island between 430 and 250 bc 41 the igneri tribe migrated to puerto rico between 120 and 400 ad from the region of the orinoco river in northern south america the arcaico and igneri co-existed on the island between the 4th and 10th centuries between the 7th and 11th centuries the taíno culture developed on the island by approximately 1000 ad it had become dominant at the time of columbus arrival an estimated 30,000 to 60,000 taíno amerindians led by the cacique chief agüeybaná inhabited the island they called it boriken meaning the great land of the valiant and noble lord  43 the natives lived in small villages

early settlement when columbus arrived in puerto rico during his second voyage on november 19, 1493, the island was inhabited by the taíno they called it borikén borinquen in spanish transliteration  columbus named the island san juan bautista in honor of st john the baptist e having reported the findings of his first travel columbus brought with him this time a letter from king ferdinand 46 empowered by a papal bull that authorized any course of action necessary for the expansion of the spanish empire and the christian faith juan ponce de león a lieutenant under columbus founded the first spanish settlement caparra on august 8, 1508. he later served as the first governor of the island f eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as puerto rico and san juan became the name of the main trading shipping port at the beginning of the 16th century the spanish people began to colonize the island despite the laws of burgos of 1512 and other decrees for the protection of the indigenous population some taíno indians were forced into an encomienda system of forced labor in the early years of colonization the population suffered extremely high fatalities from epidemics of european infectious diseases g h i j k colonization the habsburgs in 1520, king charles i of spain issued a royal decree collectively emancipating the remaining taíno population by that time the taíno people were few in number 54 enslaved africans had already begun to compensate for the native labor loss but their numbers were proportionate to the diminished commercial interest spain soon began to demonstrate for the island colony other nearby islands like cuba saint-domingue and guadeloupe attracted more of the slave trade than puerto rico probably because of greater agricultural interests in those islands on which colonists had developed large sugar plantations and had the capital to invest in the atlantic slave trade 55 from the beginning of the country the colonial administration relied heavily on the industry of enslaved africans and creole blacks for public works and defenses primarily in coastal ports and cities where the tiny colonial population had hunkered down with no significant industries or large-scale agricultural production as yet enslaved and free communities lodged around the few littoral settlements particularly around san juan also forming lasting afro-creole communities meanwhile in the island s interior there developed a mixed and independent peasantry that relied on a subsistence economy this mostly unsupervised population supplied villages and settlements with foodstuffs and in relative isolation set the pattern for what later would be known as the puerto rican jíbaro culture by the end of the 16th century the spanish empire was diminishing and in the face of increasing raids from european competitors the colonial administration throughout the americas fell into a bunker mentality  imperial strategists and urban planners redesigned port settlements into military posts with the objective of protecting spanish territorial claims and ensuring the safe passing of the king s silver-laden atlantic fleet to the iberian peninsula san juan served as an important port-of-call for ships driven across the atlantic by its powerful trade winds west indies convoys linked spain to the island sailing between cádiz and the spanish west indies the colony s seat of government was on the forested islet of san juan and for a time became one of the most heavily fortified settlements in the spanish caribbean earning the name of the walled city  the islet is still dotted with the various forts and walls such as la fortaleza castillo san felipe del morro and castillo san cristóbal designed to protect the population and the strategic port of san juan from the raids of the spanish european competitors hendricksz 1625 attack on san juan puerto rico in 1625, in the battle of san juan the dutch commander boudewijn hendricksz tested the defenses limits like no one else before learning from francis drake s previous failures here he circumvented the cannons of the castle of san felipe del morro and quickly brought his 17 ships into the san juan bay he then occupied the port and attacked the city while the population hurried for shelter behind the morro s moat and high battlements historians consider this event the worst attack on san juan though the dutch set the village on fire they failed to conquer the morro and its batteries pounded their troops and ships until hendricksz deemed the cause lost hendricksz s expedition eventually helped propel a fortification frenzy constructions of defenses for the san cristóbal hill were soon ordered so as to prevent the landing of invaders out of reach of the morro s artillery urban planning responded to the needs of keeping the colony in spanish hands late colonial period hacienda la fortuna a sugar mill complex in puerto rico painted by francisco oller in 1885 brooklyn museum during the late 16th and early 17th centuries spain concentrated its colonial efforts on the more prosperous mainland north central and south american colonies with the advent of the lively bourbon dynasty in spain in the 1700s the island of puerto rico began a gradual shift to more imperial attention more roads began connecting previously isolated inland settlements to coastal cities and coastal settlements like arecibo mayaguez and ponce began acquiring importance of their own separate from san juan by the end of the 18th century merchant ships from an array of nationalities threatened the tight regulations of the mercantilist system which turned each colony solely toward the european metropole and limited contact with other nations u.s ships came to surpass spanish trade and with this also came the exploitation of the island s natural resources slavers which had made but few stops on the island before began selling more enslaved africans to growing sugar and coffee plantations the increasing number of atlantic wars in which the caribbean islands played major roles like the war of jenkins ear the seven years war and the atlantic revolutions ensured puerto rico s growing esteem in madrid s eyes on april 17, 1797, sir ralph abercromby fleet invaded the island with a force of 6,000–13,000 men 56 which included german soldiers and royal marines and 60 to 64 ships fierce fighting continued for the next days with spanish troops both sides suffered heavy losses on sunday april 30 the british ceased their attack

bernabé and maría de las mercedes barbudo the movement was discovered and governor miguel de la torre had its members imprisoned or exiled 58 with the increasingly rapid growth of independent former spanish colonies in the south and central american states in the first part of the 19th century the spanish crown considered puerto rico and cuba of strategic importance to increase its hold on its last two new world colonies the spanish crown revived the royal decree of graces of 1815 as a result of which 450,000 immigrants mainly spaniards settled on the island in the period up until the american conquest printed in three languages—spanish english and french—it was intended to also attract non-spanish europeans with the hope that the independence movements would lose their popularity if new settlers had stronger ties to the crown hundreds of non spanish families mainly from corsica france germany ireland italy and scotland also immigrated to the island 59 free land was offered as an incentive to those who wanted to populate the two islands on the condition that they swear their loyalty to the spanish crown and allegiance to the roman catholic church 59 the offer was very

voters in favor of a change in status with full statehood the preferred option of those who wanted a change because there were almost 500,000 blank ballots in the 2012 referendum creating confusion as to the voters true desire congress decided to ignore the vote 99 100 the first three plebiscites provided voters with three options statehood free association and independence the puerto rican status referendum 2017 in june 2017 was going to offer only two options statehood and independence free association however a letter from the donald trump administration recommended adding the commonwealth the current status in the plebiscite the option had been removed from this plebiscite in response to the results of the plebiscite in 2012 which asked whether to remain in the current status and no

outcome was announced the department told the associated press that it had not reviewed or approved the ballot’s language  103 former governor aníbal acevedo vilá 2005–2009 is convinced that statehood is not the solution for either the u.s or for puerto rico for economic identity and cultural reasons  he pointed out that voter turnout for the 2017 referendum was extremely low and suggests that a

statehood include an additional 10 billion per year in federal funds the right to vote in presidential elections higher social security and medicare benefits and a right for its government agencies and municipalities to file for bankruptcy the latter is currently prohibited 108 statehood might be useful as a means of dealing with the financial crisis since it would allow for bankruptcy and the relevant protection according to the government development bank this might be the only solution to the debt crisis congress has the power to vote to allow chapter 9 protection without the need for statehood but in late 2015 there was very little support in the house for this concept other benefits to statehood include increased disability benefits and medicaid funding the right to vote in

the people can be unilaterally revoked by the u.s congress and that u.s congress can also withdraw the u.s citizenship of puerto rican residents of puerto rico at any time for a legitimate federal purpose 122 123 the application of the u.s constitution to puerto rico is limited by the insular cases in 2006, 124 2007, 125 2009, 126 2010, 127 and 2011 128 the united nations special committee on

does not contemplate sovereign territories  that the court has consistently recognized that there is no sovereignty in a territory of the united states but that of the united states itself  and a u.s

very well  in puerto rico public school instruction is conducted almost entirely in spanish there have been pilot programs in about a dozen of the over 1,400 public schools aimed at conducting instruction in english only objections from teaching staff are common perhaps because many of them are not fully fluent in english 208 english is taught as a second language and is a compulsory subject from elementary levels to high school the languages of the deaf community are american sign language and its local variant puerto rican sign language the spanish of puerto rico has evolved into having many idiosyncrasies in vocabulary and syntax that differentiate it from the spanish spoken elsewhere as a product of puerto rican history the island possesses a unique spanish dialect puerto rican spanish utilizes many taíno words as well as english words the largest influence on the spanish spoken in puerto rico is that of the canary islands the spanish of puerto rico also includes taíno words typically in the context of vegetation natural phenomena or primitive musical instruments similarly words attributed to primarily west african languages were adopted in the

and or ifá and the kongo-derived palo mayombe some aspects were absorbed into syncretic christianity protestantism which was suppressed under the spanish catholic regime has slightly reemerged under united states rule making contemporary puerto rico more interconfessional than in previous centuries although catholicism continues to be the dominant religion the first protestant church iglesia de la santísima trinidad was established in ponce by the anglican diocese of antigua in 1872. 213 it was the first non-roman catholic church in the entire spanish empire in the americas 214 215 pollster pablo ramos stated in 1998 that the population was 38 roman catholic 28 pentecostal and 18 were members of independent churches which would give a protestant percentage of 46 if the last two populations are combined protestants collectively added up to almost two million people another researcher gave a more conservative assessment of the proportion of protestants puerto rico by virtue of its long political association with the united states is the most protestant of latin american countries with a protestant population of approximately 33 to 38 percent the majority of whom are pentecostal david stoll calculates that if we extrapolate the growth rates of evangelical churches from 1960–1985 for another twenty-five years puerto rico will become 75 percent evangelical ana adams

representative districts and 78 municipalities it has a republican form of government with separation of powers subject to the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the united states 234 235 its current powers are all delegated by the united states congress and lack full protection under the united states constitution 236 puerto rico s head of state is the president of the united states the government of puerto rico based on the formal republican system is composed of three branches the executive legislative and judicial branch the executive branch is headed by the governor currently ricky rosselló the legislative branch consists of a bicameral legislature called the legislative assembly made up of a senate as its upper chamber and a house of representatives as its lower chamber the senate is headed by the president of the senate currently thomas rivera schatz while the house of representatives is headed by the speaker of the house currently johnny méndez the governor and

puerto rico hosts consulates from 41 countries mainly from the americas and europe with most located in san juan 240 as an unincorporated territory of the united states puerto rico does not have any first-order administrative divisions as defined by the u.s government but has 78 municipalities at the second level mona island is not a municipality but part of the municipality of mayagüez 241 municipalities are subdivided into wards or barrios and those into sectors each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected for a four-year term the municipality of san juan previously called town  was founded first in 1521, san germán in 1570, coamo in 1579, arecibo in 1614, aguada in 1692 and ponce in 1692. an increase of settlement saw the founding of 30 municipalities in the 18th century and 34 in the 19th six were founded in the 20th century the last was florida in 1971. 242 political parties and elections main article political party strength in puerto rico the difference between the incumbent party the ppd and its opponent the pnp was a mere 0.6 in the last election this difference is common as the political landscape experiences political cycles between both parties with the ppd ruling all branches of government for 36 of the past 64 years the pnp on the other hand has ruled both the executive and legislative branch concurrently for 16 years the other 12 years experienced a divided government since 1952, puerto rico has had three main political parties the popular democratic party ppd in spanish  the new progressive party pnp in spanish and the puerto rican independence party pip  the three parties stand for different political status the ppd for example seeks to maintain the island s status with the u.s as a commonwealth while the pnp on the other hand seeks to make puerto rico a state of the united states the pip in contrast seeks a complete separation from the united states by seeking to make puerto rico a sovereign nation in terms of party strength the ppd and pnp usually hold about 47 of the vote each while the pip holds only about 5  after 2007, other parties emerged on the island the first the puerto ricans for puerto rico party ppr in spanish was registered that same year the party claims that it seeks to address the islands problems from a status-neutral platform but it ceased to remain as a registered party when it failed to obtain the required number of votes in the 2008 general election four years later the 2012 election saw the emergence of the movimiento unión soberanista mus english sovereign union movement and the partido del pueblo trabajador ppt english working people s party but none obtained more than 1 of the vote other non-registered parties include the puerto rican nationalist party the socialist workers movement and the hostosian national independence movement law main articles constitution of puerto rico and law of puerto rico the insular legal system is a blend of civil law and the common law systems puerto rico is the only current u.s possession whose legal system operates primarily in a language other than american english namely spanish because the u.s federal government operates primarily in english all puerto rican attorneys must be bilingual in order to litigate in english in u.s federal courts and litigate federal preemption issues in puerto rican courts title 48 of the united states code outlines the role of the united states code to united states territories and insular areas such as puerto rico after the u.s government assumed control of puerto rico in 1901, it initiated legal reforms resulting in the adoption of codes of criminal law criminal procedure and civil procedure modeled after those then in effect in california although puerto rico has since followed the federal example of transferring criminal and civil procedure from statutory law to rules promulgated by the judiciary several portions of its criminal law still reflect the influence of the california penal code the judicial branch is headed by the chief justice of the puerto rico supreme court which is the only appellate court required by the constitution all other courts are created by the legislative assembly of puerto rico there is also a federal district court for puerto rico someone accused of a criminal act at the federal level may not be accused for the same act in a commonwealth court unlike a state court since puerto rico as a territory lacks sovereignty separate from congress as a state does 243 such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy political status main articles political status of puerto rico and proposed political status for puerto rico the nature of puerto rico s political relationship with the u.s is the subject of ongoing debate in puerto rico the united states congress and the united nations 244 specifically the basic question is whether puerto rico should remain a u.s territory become a u.s state or become an independent country 245 within the united states the capitol of puerto rico home of the legislative assembly in puerto rico constitutionally puerto rico is subject to the plenary powers of the united states congress under the territorial clause of article iv of the u.s constitution 246 laws enacted at the federal level in the united states apply to puerto rico as well regardless of its political status their residents do not have voting representation in the u.s congress like the different states of the united states puerto rico lacks the full sovereignty of an independent nation  for example the power to manage its external relations with other nations  which is held by the u.s federal government the supreme court of the united states has indicated that once the u.s constitution has been extended to an area by congress or the courts  its coverage is irrevocable to hold that the political branches may switch the constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they not this court say what the law is  247 puerto ricans were collectively made u.s citizens in 1917 as a result of the jones-shafroth act 248 u.s citizens residing in puerto rico cannot vote for the u.s president though both major parties republican and democratic run primary elections in puerto rico to send delegates to vote on a presidential candidate since puerto rico is an unincorporated territory see above and not a u.s state the united states constitution does not fully enfranchise u.s citizens residing in puerto rico 236 249 only fundamental rights under the american federal constitution and adjudications are applied to puerto ricans various other u.s supreme court decisions have held which rights apply in puerto rico and which ones do not puerto ricans have a long history of service in the u.s armed forces and since 1917, they have been included in the u.s compulsory draft whensoever it has been in effect though the commonwealth government has its own tax laws puerto ricans are also required to pay many kinds of u.s federal taxes not including the federal personal income tax for puerto rico-sourced income but only under certain circumstances 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 in 2009, puerto rico paid 3.742 billion into the u.s treasury 258 residents of puerto rico pay into social security and are thus eligible for social security benefits upon retirement they are excluded from the supplemental security income ssi  and the island actually receives a smaller fraction of the medicaid funding it would receive if it were a u.s state 259 also medicare providers receive less-than-full state-like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in puerto rico even though the latter paid fully into the system 260 while a state may try an individual for the same crime he she was tried in federal court this is not the case in puerto rico being a u.s territory puerto rico s authority to enact a criminal code derives from congress and not from local sovereignty as with the states thus such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy and is constitutionally impermissible 243 in 1992, president george h w bush issued a memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the commonwealth of puerto rico this memorandum directs all federal departments agencies and officials to treat puerto rico administratively as if it were a state insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operations many federal executive branch agencies have significant presence in puerto rico just as in any state including the federal bureau of investigation federal emergency management agency transportation security administration social security administration and others while puerto rico has its own commonwealth judicial system similar to that of a u.s state there is also a u.s federal district court in puerto rico and puerto ricans have served as judges in that court and in other federal courts on the u.s mainland regardless of their residency status at the time of their appointment sonia sotomayor a new

and panamá 261 262 it has also established trade promotion offices in many foreign countries all spanish-speaking and within the united states itself which now include spain the dominican republic panama colombia washington d.c. new york city and florida and has included in the past offices in chile costa rica and mexico such agreements require permission from the u.s department of state most are simply allowed by existing laws or trade treaties between the united states and other nations which supersede trade agreements pursued by puerto rico and different u.s states at the local level puerto rico established by law that the international relations which states and territories are allowed to engage must be handled by the department of state of puerto rico an executive department headed by the secretary of state of puerto rico who also serves as the territory s lieutenant governor it is also charged to liaise with general consuls and honorary consuls based in puerto rico the puerto rico federal affairs administration along with the office of the resident commissioner manage all its intergovernmental affairs before entities of or in the united states including the federal government of the united states local and state governments of the united states and public or private entities in the united states  both entities frequently assist the department of state of puerto rico in engaging with washington d.c.-based ambassadors and federal agencies that handle puerto rico s foreign affairs such as the u.s department of state the agency for international development and others the current secretary of state is víctor suárez meléndez from the popular democratic party and member of the democratic party of the united states while the current director of the puerto rico

guard and its own state defense force the puerto rico state guard which by local law is under the authority of the puerto rico national guard the commander-in-chief of both local forces is the governor of puerto rico who delegates his authority to the puerto rico adjutant general currently colonel marta carcana the adjutant general in turn delegates the authority over the state guard to another officer but retains the authority over the puerto rico national guard as a whole u.s military installations in puerto rico including the united states virgin islands throughout the 20th century u.s military installations in puerto rico were part of the u.s atlantic command lantcom after 1993 usacom  which had authority over all u.s military operations that took place throughout the atlantic puerto rico had been seen as crucial in supporting lantcom s mission until 1999, when u.s atlantic command was renamed and given a new mission as united states joint forces command puerto rico is currently under the responsibility of united states northern command both the naval forces caribbean nfc and the fleet air caribbean fair were formerly based at the roosevelt roads naval station the nfc had authority over all u.s naval activity in the waters of the caribbean while fair had authority over all u.s military flights and air operations over the caribbean with the closing of the roosevelt roads and vieques island training facilities the u.s navy has basically exited from puerto rico except for the ships that steam by and the only significant military presence in the island is the u.s army at ft buchanan the puerto rican army and air national guards and the u.s coast guard protests over the noise of bombing practice forced the closure of the naval base this resulted in a loss of 6,000 jobs and an annual decrease in local income of 300 million 264 a branch of the u.s army national guard is stationed in puerto rico — known as the puerto rico army national guard — which performs missions equivalent to those of the army national guards of the different states of the united states including ground defense disaster relief and control of civil unrest the

considered their deactivations but these have been opposed by diverse public and private entities in puerto rico – such as retired military who rely on ft buchanan for the services available there puerto ricans have participated in many of the military conflicts in which the united states has been involved for example they participated in the american revolution when volunteers from puerto rico cuba and mexico fought the british in 1779 under the command of general bernardo de gálvez 1746–1786  267 and have continued to participate up to the present-day conflicts in iraq and afghanistan 268

puerto rico s gross domestic product gdp by economic sector the economy of puerto rico is classified as a high income economy by the world bank and as the most competitive economy in latin america by

manufacturing primarily pharmaceuticals textiles petrochemicals and electronics followed by the service industry primarily finance insurance real estate and tourism  n o in recent years the territory has also become a popular destination for mice meetings incentives conferencing exhibitions  with a modern convention centre district overlooking the port of san juan 274 the geography of puerto rico and its political status are both determining factors on its economic prosperity primarily due to its relatively small size as an island its lack of natural resources used to produce raw materials citation needed  and consequently its dependence on imports as well as its territorial status with the united states which controls its foreign policy while exerting trading restrictions particularly in its shipping industry puerto rico experienced a recession from 2006 to 2011, interrupted by 4 quarters of economic growth and entered into recession again in 2013, following growing fiscal imbalance and the expiration of the irs section 936 corporate incentives that the u.s internal revenue code had applied to puerto rico this irs section was critical to the economy as it established tax exemptions for u.s corporations that settled in puerto rico and allowed their insular subsidiaries to send their earnings to the parent corporation at any time without paying federal tax on corporate income puerto rico has surprisingly been able to maintain a relatively low inflation in the past decade while maintaining a purchasing power parity per capita higher than 80 of the rest of the world 275 academically most of puerto rico s economic woes stem from federal regulations that expired have been repealed or no longer apply to puerto rico its inability to become self-sufficient and self-sustainable throughout history p its highly politicized public policy which tends to change whenever a political party gains power q as well as its highly inefficient local government r s which has accrued a public debt equal to 68 of its gross domestic product throughout time t u in comparison to the different states of the united states puerto rico is poorer than mississippi the

united states itself ireland and japan with most products coming from east asia mainly from china hong kong and taiwan at a global scale puerto rico s dependency on oil for transportation and electricity generation as well as its dependency on food imports and raw materials makes puerto rico volatile and highly reactive to changes in the world economy and climate puerto rico s agricultural sector represents less than 1 of gnp 282 heavy debt load in early 2017, the puerto rican government-debt crisis posed serious problems for the government which was saddled with outstanding bond debt that had climbed to 70 billion at a time with a 45 percent poverty rate and 12.4 unemployment that is more than twice the mainland u.s average 283 the debt had been increasing during a decade long recession 27 the commonwealth had been defaulting on many debts including bonds since 2015. with debt payments due the governor was facing the risk of a government shutdown and failure to fund the managed health care system 284 285 without action before april puerto rico’s ability to execute contracts for fiscal year 2018 with its managed care organizations will be threatened thereby putting at risk beginning july 1, 2017 the health care of up to 900,000 poor u.s citizens living in puerto rico  according to a letter sent to congress by the secretary of the treasury and the secretary of health and human services they also said that congress must enact measures recommended by both republicans and democrats that fix puerto rico’s inequitable health care financing structure and promote sustained economic growth 285 initially the oversight board created under promesa called for puerto rico s governor ricardo rosselló to deliver a fiscal turnaround plan by january 28. just before that deadline the control board gave the commonwealth government until february 28 to present a fiscal plan including negotiations with creditors for restructuring debt to solve the problems a moratorium on lawsuits by debtors was extended to may 31. 27 it is essential for puerto rico to reach restructuring deals to avoid a bankruptcy-like process under promesa 286 an internal survey conducted by the puerto rican economists association revealed that the majority of puerto rican economists reject the policy recommendations of the board and the rosselló government with more than 80 of economists arguing in favor of auditing the debt 287 in early august 2017, the island s financial oversight board created by promesa planned to institute two days off without pay per month for government employees down from the original plan of four days per month the latter had been expected to achieve 218 million in savings governor rossello rejected this plan as unjustified and unnecessary pension reforms were also discussed including a proposal for a 10 reduction in benefits to begin addressing the 50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities 30 288 public finances main articles puerto rico government-debt crisis budget of the government of puerto rico and public debt of puerto rico puerto rico has an operating budget of about u.s 9.8 billion with expenses at about 10.4 billion creating a structural deficit of 775 million about 7.9 of the budget  289 the practice of approving budgets with a structural deficit has been done for 17 consecutive years starting in 2000. throughout those years including present time all budgets contemplated issuing bonds to cover said projected deficits rather than make proper adjustments this practice eroded puerto rico s treasury as the government had already been issuing bonds to balance its actual budget for four decades since 1973. w 291 the 2012 budget of the government of puerto rico projected deficits added substantial burdens to an already indebted nation which accrued a public debt of 71b or about 70 of puerto rico s gross domestic product this sparked an ongoing government-debt crisis after puerto rico s general obligation bonds were downgraded to speculative non-investment grade junk status by three credit rating agencies in terms of financial control almost 9.6 —or about 1.5 billion—of puerto rico s central government budget expenses for fy2014 is expected to be spent on debt service x harsher budget cuts are expected as puerto rico must now repay larger chunks of debts in the following years needs update for practical reasons the budget is divided into two aspects a general budget which comprises the assignments funded exclusively by the department of treasury of puerto rico and the consolidated budget which comprises the assignments funded by the general budget by puerto rico s government-owned corporations by revenue expected from loans by the sale of government bonds by subsidies extended by the federal government of the united states and by other funds both budgets contrast each other drastically with the consolidated budget being usually thrice the size of the general budget currently 29b and 9.0b respectively almost one out of every four dollars in the consolidated budget comes from u.s federal subsidies while government-owned corporations compose more than 31 of the consolidated budget the critical aspects come from the sale of bonds which comprise 7 of the consolidated budget a ratio that increased annually due to the government s inability to prepare a balanced budget in addition to being incapable of generating enough income to cover all its expenses in particular the government-owned corporations add a heavy burden to the overall budget and public debt as not a single one is self-sufficient all of them carrying extremely inefficient operations for example in fy2011 the government-owned corporations reported aggregated losses of more than 1.3b with the puerto rico highways and transportation authority prhta reporting losses of 409m the puerto rico electric power authority prepa the government monopoly that controls all electricity on the island reporting losses of 272m while the puerto rico aqueducts and sewers authority prasa the government monopoly that controls all water utilities on the island reported losses of 112m 293 losses by government-owned corporations have been defrayed through the issuance of bonds compounding more than 40 of puerto rico s entire public debt today 294 holistically from fy2000–fy2010 puerto rico s debt grew at a compound annual growth rate cagr of 9 while gdp remained stagnant 295 this has not always provided a long-term solution in early july 2017 for example the prepa power authority was effectively bankrupt after defaulting in a plan to restructure 9 billion in bond debt the agency planned to seek court protection 296 in terms of protocol the governor together with the puerto rico office of management and budget ogp in spanish  formulates the budget he believes is required to operate all government branches for the ensuing fiscal year he then submits this formulation as a budget request to the puerto rican legislature before july 1, the date established by law as the beginning of puerto rico s fiscal year while the constitution establishes that the request must be submitted at the beginning of each regular session  the request is typically submitted during the first week of may as the regular sessions of the legislature begin in january and it would be unpractical to submit a request so far ahead once submitted the budget is then approved by the legislature typically with amendments through a joint resolution and referred back to the governor for his approval the governor then either approves it or vetoes it if vetoed the legislature can then either refer it back with amendments for the governor s approval or approve it without the governor s consent by two-thirds of the bodies of each chamber 297 once approved the department of treasury disburses funds to the office of management and budget which in turn disburses the funds to the respective agencies all while the puerto rico government development bank the government s intergovernmental bank manages all related banking affairs including those related to the government-owned corporations cost of living a map of jones act carrier routes for puerto rico the cost of living in puerto rico is high and has increased over the past decade y 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 san juan s in particular is higher than atlanta dallas and seattle but lower than boston chicago and new york city 305 one factor is housing prices which are comparable to miami and los angeles although property taxes are considerably lower than most places in the united states z statistics used for cost of living sometimes do not take into account certain costs such as the high cost of electricity which has hovered in the 24¢ to 30¢ range per kilowatt hour two to three times the national average increased travel costs for longer flights additional shipping fees and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers outside the continental united states  while some online stores do offer free shipping on orders to puerto rico many merchants exclude hawaii alaska puerto rico and other united states territories the household median income is stated as 19,350 and the mean income as 30,463 in the u.s census bureau s 2015 update the report also indicates that 45.5 of individuals are below the poverty level 307 the median home value in puerto rico ranges from u.s 100,000 to u.s 214,000, while the national median home value sits at 119,600. aa one of the most cited contributors to the high cost of living in puerto rico is the merchant marine act of 1920, also known as the jones act which prevents foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two american ports a practice known as cabotage 309 because of the jones act foreign ships inbound with goods from central and south america western europe and africa cannot stop in puerto rico offload puerto rico-bound goods load mainland-bound puerto rico-manufactured goods and continue to u.s ports instead they must proceed directly to u.s ports where distributors break bulk and send puerto rico-bound manufactured goods to puerto rico across the ocean by u.s.-flagged ships 309 the local government of puerto rico has requested several times to the u.s congress to exclude puerto rico from the jones act restrictions without success ab the most recent measure has been taken by the 17th legislative assembly of puerto rico through r conc del s 21. 311 312 these measures have always received support from all the major local political parties in 2013 the government accountability office published a report which concluded that repealing or amending the jones act cabotage law might cut puerto rico shipping costs and that shippers believed that opening the trade to non-u.s.-flag competition could lower costs  ac ad however the same gao report also found that shippers doing business in puerto rico that gao contacted reported that the freight rates are often—although not always—lower for foreign carriers going to and from puerto rico and foreign locations than the rates shippers pay to ship similar cargo to and from the united states despite longer distances data were not available to allow us to validate the examples given or verify the extent to which this difference occurred 314 ultimately the report concluded that the effects of modifying the application of the jones act for puerto rico are highly uncertain for both puerto rico and the united states particularly for the u.s shipping industry and the military preparedness of the united states 313 314 education main article education in puerto rico the first school in puerto rico was the escuela de gramática grammar school  it was established by bishop alonso manso in
