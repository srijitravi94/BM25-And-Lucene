meteorology severe weather weather forecasting weather portal v t e rain typical sound of rain with thunder problems playing this file see media help rain is liquid water in the form of droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then becomes heavy enough to fall under gravity rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the earth it provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation the major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts if enough moisture and upward motion is present precipitation falls from convective clouds those with strong upward vertical motion such as cumulonimbus thunder clouds which can organize into narrow rainbands in mountainous areas heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall along the sides of mountains on the leeward side of mountains desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass the movement of the monsoon trough or intertropical convergence zone brings rainy seasons to savannah climes the urban heat island effect leads to increased rainfall both in amounts and intensity downwind of cities global warming is also causing changes in the precipitation pattern globally including wetter conditions across eastern north america and drier conditions in the tropics citation needed antarctica is the driest continent the globally averaged annual precipitation over land is 715 mm 28.1 in  but over the whole earth it is much higher at 990 mm 39 in  1 climate classification systems such as the köppen classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes rainfall is measured using rain gauges rainfall amounts can be estimated by weather radar rain is also known or suspected on other planets where it may be composed of methane neon sulfuric acid or even iron rather than water formation water-saturated air play media falling rain rain falling on a field in southern estonia air contains water vapor and the amount of water in a given mass of dry air known as the mixing ratio is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air g kg  2 3 the amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature 4 how much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated 100 relative humidity and forms into a cloud a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the earth s surface 5 depends on its temperature warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated therefore one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it the dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated 6 there are four main mechanisms for cooling the air to its dew point adiabatic cooling conductive cooling radiational cooling and evaporative cooling adiabatic cooling occurs when air rises and expands 7 the air can rise due to convection large-scale atmospheric motions or a physical barrier such as a mountain orographic lift  conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface 8 usually by being blown from one surface to another for example from a liquid water surface to colder land radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation either by the air or by the surface underneath 9 evaporative cooling occurs when moisture is added to the air through evaporation which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet-bulb temperature or until it reaches saturation 10 the main ways water vapor is added to the air are wind convergence into areas of upward motion 11 precipitation or virga falling from above 12 daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans water bodies or wet land 13 transpiration from plants 14 cool or dry air moving over warmer water 15 and lifting air over mountains 16 water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust ice and salt in order to form clouds elevated portions of weather fronts which are three-dimensional in nature 17 force broad areas of upward motion within the earth s atmosphere which form clouds decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus 18 stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass it can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during breezy conditions 19 coalescence and fragmentation the shape of rain drops depending upon their size coalescence occurs when water droplets fuse to create larger water droplets air resistance typically causes the water droplets in a cloud to remain stationary when air turbulence occurs water droplets collide producing larger droplets black rain clouds as these larger water droplets descend coalescence continues so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain coalescence generally happens most often in clouds above freezing and is also known as the warm rain process 20 in clouds below freezing when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall this generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring water droplets this process is temperature dependent as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing in addition because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain 21 raindrops have sizes ranging from 0.1 to 9 mm 0.0039 to 0.3543 in mean diameter above which they tend to break up smaller drops are called cloud droplets and their shape is spherical as a raindrop increases in size its shape becomes more oblate with its largest cross-section facing the oncoming airflow large rain drops become increasingly flattened on the bottom like hamburger buns very large ones are shaped like parachutes 22 23 contrary to popular belief their shape does not resemble a teardrop 24 the biggest raindrops on earth were recorded over brazil and the marshall islands in 2004 — some of them were as large as 10 mm 0.39 in  the large size is explained by condensation on large smoke particles or by collisions between drops in small regions with particularly high content of liquid water 25 rain drops associated with melting hail tend to be larger than other rain drops 26 a raindrop on a leaf intensity and duration of rainfall are usually inversely related i.e. high intensity storms are likely to be of short duration and low intensity storms can have a long duration 27 28 droplet size distribution the final droplet size distribution is an exponential distribution the number of droplets with diameter between d \displaystyle d and d d d \displaystyle d dd per unit volume of space is n d n 0 e − d ⟨ d ⟩ d d \displaystyle n d n 0 e -d \langle d\rangle dd  this is commonly referred to as the marshall–palmer law after the researchers who first characterized it 23 29 the parameters are somewhat temperature-dependent 30 and the slope also scales with the rate of rainfall ⟨ d ⟩ − 1 41 r − 0.21 \displaystyle \langle d\rangle -1 41r -0.21 d in centimeters and r in millimetres per hour  23 deviations can occur for small droplets and during different rainfall conditions the distribution tends to fit averaged rainfall while instantaneous size spectra often deviate and have been modeled as gamma distributions 31 the distribution has an upper limit due to droplet fragmentation 23 raindrop impacts raindrops impact at their terminal velocity which is greater for larger drops due to their larger mass to drag ratio at sea level and without wind 0.5 mm 0.020 in drizzle impacts at 2 m s 6.6 ft s or 7.2 km h 4.5 mph  while large 5 mm 0.20 in drops impact at around 9 m s 30 ft s or 32 km h 20 mph  32 rain falling on loosely packed material such as newly fallen ash can produce dimples that can be fossilized 33 the air density dependence of the maximum raindrop diameter together with fossil raindrop imprints has been used to constrain the density of the air 2.7 billion years ago 34 the sound of raindrops hitting water is caused by bubbles of air oscillating underwater 35 36 the metar code for rain is ra while the coding for rain showers is shra 37 virga main article virga in certain conditions precipitation may fall from a cloud but then evaporate or sublime before reaching the ground this is termed virga and is more often seen in hot and dry climates causes frontal activity main article weather fronts stratiform a broad shield of precipitation with a relatively similar intensity and dynamic precipitation convective precipitation which is showery in nature with large changes in intensity over short distances occur as a consequence of slow ascent of air in synoptic systems on the order of cm s  such as in the vicinity of cold fronts and near and poleward of surface warm fronts similar ascent is seen around tropical cyclones outside of the eyewall and in comma-head precipitation patterns around mid-latitude cyclones 38 a wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front with thunderstorms possible but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass occluded fronts usually form around mature low-pressure areas 39 what separates rainfall from other precipitation types such as ice pellets and snow is the presence of a thick layer of air aloft which is above the melting point of water which melts the frozen precipitation well before it reaches the ground if there is a shallow near surface layer that is below freezing freezing rain rain which freezes on contact with surfaces in subfreezing environments will result 40 hail becomes an increasingly infrequent occurrence when the freezing level within the atmosphere exceeds 3,400 m 11,000 ft above ground level 41 convection convective precipitation orographic precipitation convective rain or showery precipitation occurs from convective clouds e.g. cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus  it falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent most precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective however it has been suggested that stratiform precipitation also occurs 38 42 graupel and hail indicate convection 43 in mid-latitudes convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts squall lines and warm fronts 44 orographic effects main articles orographic lift precipitation types meteorology  and united states rainfall climatology orographic precipitation occurs on the windward side of mountains and is caused by the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation in mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds for example the trade winds  a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side moisture is removed by orographic lift leaving drier air see katabatic wind on the descending and generally warming leeward side where a rain shadow is observed 16 in hawaii mount waiʻaleʻale on the island of kauai is notable for its extreme rainfall as it has the second highest average annual rainfall on earth with 12,000 mm 460 in  45 systems known as kona storms affect the state with heavy rains between october and april 46 local climates vary considerably on each island due to their topography divisible into windward koʻolau and leeward kona regions based upon location relative to the higher mountains windward sides face the east to northeast trade winds and receive much more rainfall leeward sides are drier and sunnier with less rain and less cloud cover 47 in south america the andes mountain range blocks pacific moisture that arrives in that continent resulting in a desertlike climate just downwind across western argentina 48 the sierra nevada range creates the same effect in north america forming the great basin and mojave deserts 49 50 within the tropics rainfall distribution by month in cairns showing the extent of the wet season at that location see also monsoon and tropical cyclone main article wet season the wet or rainy season is the time of year covering one or more months when most of the average annual rainfall in a region falls 51 the term green season is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities 52 areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics 53 savanna climates and areas with monsoon regimes have wet summers and dry winters tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year 54 some areas with pronounced rainy seasons will see a break in rainfall mid-season when the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon trough move poleward of their location during the middle of the warm season 27 when the wet season occurs during the warm season or summer rain falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours the wet season is a time when air quality improves 55 freshwater quality improves 56 57 and vegetation grows significantly tropical cyclones a source of very heavy rainfall consist of large air masses several hundred miles across with low pressure at the centre and with winds blowing inward towards the centre in either a clockwise direction southern hemisphere or counter clockwise northern hemisphere  58 although cyclones can take an enormous toll in lives and personal property they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they impact as they may bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions 59 areas in their path can receive a year s worth of rainfall from a tropical cyclone passage 60 human influence image of atlanta georgia showing temperature distribution with blue showing cool temperatures red warm and hot areas appearing white mean surface temperature anomalies during the period 1999 to 2008 with respect to the average temperatures from 1940 to 1980 see also global warming and urban heat island the fine particulate matter produced by car exhaust and other human sources of pollution forms cloud condensation nuclei leads to the production of clouds and increases the likelihood of rain as commuters and commercial traffic cause pollution to build up over the course of the week the likelihood of rain increases it peaks by saturday after five days of weekday pollution has been built up in heavily populated areas that are near the coast such as the united states eastern seaboard the effect can be dramatic there is a 22 higher chance of rain on saturdays than on mondays 61 the urban heat island effect warms cities 0.6 to 5.6 °c 1.1 to 10.1 °f above surrounding suburbs and rural areas this extra heat leads to greater upward motion which can induce additional shower and thunderstorm activity rainfall rates downwind of cities are increased between 48 and 116  partly as a result of this warming monthly rainfall is about 28 greater between 32 to 64 km 20 to 40 mi downwind of cities compared with upwind 62 some cities induce a total precipitation increase of 51  63 increasing temperatures tend to increase evaporation which can lead to more precipitation precipitation generally increased over land north of 30°n from 1900 through 2005 but has declined over the tropics since the 1970s globally there has been no statistically significant overall trend in precipitation over the past century although trends have varied widely by region and over time eastern portions of north and south america northern europe and northern and central asia have become wetter the sahel the mediterranean southern africa and parts of southern asia have become drier there has been an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts—especially in the tropics and subtropics changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by the decreased salinity of mid- and high-latitude waters implying more precipitation  along with increased salinity in lower latitudes implying less precipitation and or more evaporation  over the contiguous united states total annual precipitation increased at an average rate of 6.1 percent since 1900, with the greatest increases within the east north central climate region 11.6 percent per century and the south 11.1 percent  hawaii was the only region to show a decrease −9.25 percent  64 analysis of 65 years of united states of america rainfall records show the lower 48 states have an increase in heavy downpours since 1950. the largest increases are in the northeast and midwest which in the past decade have seen 31 and 16 percent more heavy downpours compared to the 1950s rhode island is the state with the largest increase 104  mcallen texas is the city with the largest increase 700  heavy downpour in the analysis are the days where total precipitation exceeded the top 1 percent of all rain and snow days during the years 1950-2014 65 66 the most successful attempts at influencing weather involve cloud seeding which include techniques used to increase winter precipitation over mountains and suppress hail 67 characteristics patterns band of thunderstorms seen on a weather radar display main article rainband rainbands are cloud and precipitation areas which are significantly elongated rainbands can be stratiform or convective 68 and are generated by differences in temperature when noted on weather radar imagery this precipitation elongation is referred to as banded structure 69 rainbands in advance of warm occluded fronts and warm fronts are associated with weak upward motion 70 and tend to be wide and stratiform in nature 71 rainbands spawned near and ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which are able to produce tornadoes 72 rainbands associated with cold fronts can be warped by mountain barriers perpendicular to the front s orientation due to the formation of a low-level barrier jet 73 bands of thunderstorms can form with sea breeze and land breeze boundaries if enough moisture is present if sea breeze rainbands become active enough just ahead of a cold front they can mask the location of the cold front itself 74 once a cyclone occludes a trough of warm air aloft or trowal for short will be caused by strong southerly winds on its eastern periphery rotating aloft around its northeast and ultimately northwestern periphery also known as the warm conveyor belt  forcing a surface trough to continue into the cold sector on a similar curve to the occluded front the trowal creates the portion of an occluded cyclone known as its comma head due to the comma-like shape of the mid-tropospheric cloudiness that accompanies the feature it can also be the focus of locally heavy precipitation with thunderstorms possible if the atmosphere along the trowal is unstable enough for convection 75 banding within the comma head precipitation pattern of an extratropical cyclone can yield significant amounts of rain 76 behind extratropical cyclones during fall and winter rainbands can form downwind of relative warm bodies of water such as the great lakes downwind of islands bands of showers and thunderstorms can develop due to low level wind convergence downwind of the island edges offshore california this has been noted in the wake of cold fronts 77 rainbands within tropical cyclones are curved in orientation tropical cyclone rainbands contain showers and thunderstorms that together with the eyewall and the eye constitute a hurricane or tropical storm the extent of rainbands around a tropical cyclone can help determine the cyclone s intensity 78 acidity sources of acid rain see also acid rain the phrase acid rain was first used by scottish chemist robert augus smith in 1852. 79 the ph of rain varies especially due to its origin on america s east coast rain that is derived from the atlantic ocean typically has a ph of 5.0-5.6 rain that comes across the continental from the west has a ph of 3.8-4.8 and local thunderstorms can have a ph as low as 2.0. 80 rain becomes acidic primarily due to the presence of two strong acids sulfuric acid h2so4 and nitric acid hno3  sulfuric acid is derived from natural sources such as volcanoes and wetlands sulfate reducing bacteria and anthropogenic sources such as the combustion of fossil fuels and mining where h2s is present nitric acid is produced by natural sources such as lightning soil bacteria and natural fires while also produced anthropogenically by the combustion of fossil fuels and from power plants in the past 20 years the concentrations of nitric and sulfuric acid has decreased in presence of rainwater which may be due to the significant increase in ammonium most likely as ammonia from livestock production  which acts as a buffer in acid rain and raises the ph 81 köppen climate classification updated köppen-geiger climate map 82 af am aw bwh bwk bsh bsk csa csb cwa cwb cfa cfb cfc dsa dsb dsc dsd dwa dwb dwc dwd dfa dfb dfc dfd et ef main article köppen climate classification the köppen classification depends on average monthly values of temperature and precipitation the most commonly used form of the köppen classification has five primary types labeled a through e specifically the primary types are a tropical b dry c mild mid-latitude d cold mid-latitude and e polar the five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as rain forest monsoon tropical savanna humid subtropical humid continental oceanic climate mediterranean climate steppe subarctic climate tundra polar ice cap and desert rain forests are characterized by high rainfall with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between 1,750 and 2,000 mm 69 and 79 in  83 a tropical savanna is a grassland biome located in semi-arid to semi-humid climate regions of subtropical and tropical latitudes with rainfall between 750 and 1,270 mm 30 and 50 in a year they are widespread on africa and are also found in india the northern parts of south america malaysia and australia 84 the humid subtropical climate zone is where winter rainfall is associated with large storms that the westerlies steer from west to east most summer rainfall occurs during thunderstorms and from occasional tropical cyclones 85 humid subtropical climates lie on the east side continents roughly between latitudes 20° and 40° degrees away from the equator 86 an oceanic or maritime climate is typically found along the west coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world s continents bordering cool oceans as well as southeastern australia and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year-round 87 the mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the mediterranean basin parts of western north america parts of western and south australia in southwestern south africa and in parts of central chile the climate is characterized by hot dry summers and cool wet winters 88 a steppe is a dry grassland 89 subarctic climates are cold with continuous permafrost and little precipitation 90 measurement gauges standard rain gauge see also rain gauge disdrometer and snow gauge rain is measured in units of length per unit time typically in millimeters per hour 91 or in countries where imperial units are more common inches per hour 92 the length  or more accurately depth being measured is the depth of rain water that would accumulate on a flat horizontal and impermeable surface during a given amount of time typically an hour 93 one millimeter of rainfall is the equivalent of one liter of water per square meter 94 the standard way of measuring rainfall or snowfall is the standard rain gauge which can be found in 100-mm 4-in plastic and 200-mm 8-in metal varieties 95 the inner cylinder is filled by 25 mm 0.98 in of rain with overflow flowing into the outer cylinder plastic gauges have markings on the inner cylinder down to 0.25 mm 0.0098 in resolution while metal gauges require use of a stick designed with the appropriate 0.25 mm 0.0098 in markings after the inner cylinder is filled the amount inside it is discarded then filled with the remaining rainfall in the outer cylinder until all the fluid in the outer cylinder is gone adding to the overall total until the outer cylinder is empty 96 other types of gauges include the popular wedge gauge the cheapest rain gauge and most fragile  the tipping bucket rain gauge and the weighing rain gauge 97 for those looking to measure rainfall the most inexpensively a can that is cylindrical with straight sides will act as a rain gauge if left out in the open but its accuracy will depend on what ruler is used to measure the rain with any of the above rain gauges can be made at home with enough know-how 98 when a precipitation measurement is made various networks exist across the united states and elsewhere where rainfall measurements can be submitted through the internet such as cocorahs or globe 99 100 if a network is not available in the area where one lives the nearest local weather or met office will likely be interested in the measurement 101 remote sensing see also weather radar twenty-four-hour rainfall accumulation on the val d irène radar in eastern canada zones without data in the east and southwest are caused by beam blocking from mountains source environment canada one of the main uses of weather radar is to be able to assess the amount of precipitations fallen over large basins for hydrological purposes 102 for instance river flood control sewer management and dam construction are all areas where planners use rainfall accumulation data radar-derived rainfall estimates compliment surface station data which can be used for calibration to produce radar accumulations rain rates over a point are estimated by using the value of reflectivity data at individual grid points a radar equation is then used which is z a r b \displaystyle z ar b  where z represents the radar reflectivity r represents the rainfall rate and a and b are constants 103 satellite derived rainfall estimates use passive microwave instruments aboard polar orbiting as well as geostationary weather satellites to indirectly measure rainfall rates 104 if one wants an accumulated rainfall over a time period one has to add up all the accumulations from each grid box within the images during that time play media 1988 rain in the u.s the heaviest rain is seen in reds and yellows play media 1993 rain in the u.s intensity heavy rain in glenshaw pennsylvania the sound of a heavy rain fall in suburban neighborhood problems playing this file see media help rainfall intensity is classified according to the rate of precipitation light rain — when the precipitation rate is 2.5 mm 0.098 in per hour moderate rain — when the precipitation rate is between 2.5 mm 0.098 in - 7.6 mm 0.30 in or 10 mm 0.39 in per hour 105 106 heavy rain — when the precipitation rate is 7.6 mm 0.30 in per hour 105 or between 10 mm 0.39 in and 50 mm 2.0 in per hour 106 violent rain — when the precipitation rate is 50 mm 2.0 in per hour 106 euphemisms for a heavy or violent rain include gully washer trash-mover and toad-strangler 107 the intensity can also be expressed by rainfall erosivity r-factor 108 return period see also 100-year flood the likelihood or probability of an event with a specified intensity and duration is called the return period or frequency 109 the intensity of a storm can be predicted for any return period and storm duration from charts based on historic data for the location 110 the term 1 in 10 year storm describes a rainfall event which is unusual and has a 50 chance of occurring in any 10-year period the term 1 in 100 year storm describes a rainfall event which is rare and which will occur with a 50 probability in any 100-year period as with all probability events it is possible though improbable to have multiple 1 in 100 year storms in a single year 111 forecasting main article quantitative precipitation forecast example of a five-day rainfall forecast from the hydrometeorological prediction center the quantitative precipitation forecast abbreviated qpf is the expected amount of liquid precipitation accumulated over a specified time period over a specified area 112 a qpf will be specified when a measurable precipitation type reaching a minimum threshold is forecast for any hour during a qpf valid period precipitation forecasts tend to be bound by synoptic hours such as 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 gmt terrain is considered in qpfs by use of topography or based upon climatological precipitation patterns from observations with fine detail 113 starting in the mid to late 1990s qpfs were used within hydrologic forecast models to simulate impact to rivers throughout the united states 114 forecast models show significant sensitivity to humidity levels within the planetary boundary layer or in the lowest levels of the atmosphere which decreases with height 115 qpf can be generated on a quantitative forecasting amounts or a qualitative forecasting the probability of a specific amount basis 116 radar imagery forecasting techniques show higher skill than model forecasts within 6 to 7 hours of the time of the radar image the forecasts can be verified through use of rain gauge measurements weather radar estimates or a combination of both various skill scores can be determined to measure the value of the rainfall forecast 117 impact effect on agriculture rainfall estimates for southern japan and the surrounding region from july 20–27 2009. precipitation especially rain has a dramatic effect on agriculture all plants need at least some water to survive therefore rain being the most effective means of watering is important to agriculture while a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants too much or too little rainfall can be harmful even devastating to crops drought can kill crops and increase erosion 118 while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth 119 plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive for example certain cacti require small amounts of water 120 while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive in areas with wet and dry seasons soil nutrients diminish and erosion increases during the wet season 27 animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime the previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season as the crops have yet to mature 121 developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest which occurs late in the wet season 122 rain may be harvested through the use of rainwater tanks treated to potable use or for non-potable use indoors or for irrigation 123 excessive rain during short periods of time can cause flash floods 124 in culture see also list of rain deities cultural attitudes towards rain differ across the world in temperate climates people tend to be more stressed when the weather is unstable or cloudy with its impact greater on men than women 125 rain can also bring joy as some consider it to be soothing or enjoy the aesthetic appeal of it in dry places such as india 126 or during periods of drought 127 rain lifts people s moods in botswana the setswana word for rain pula is used as the name of the national currency in recognition of the economic importance of rain in its country since it has a desert climate 128 several cultures have developed means of dealing with rain and have developed numerous protection devices such as umbrellas and raincoats and diversion devices such as gutters and storm drains that lead rains to sewers 129 many people find the scent during and immediately after rain pleasant or distinctive the source of this scent is petrichor an oil produced by plants then absorbed by rocks and soil and later released into the air during rainfall 130

the world s driest continent rainforests see also rainforest rainforests are areas of the world with very high rainfall both tropical and temperate rainforests exist tropical rainforests occupy a large band of the planet mostly along the equator most temperate rainforests are located on mountainous west coasts between 45 and 55 degrees latitude but they are often found in other areas around 40-75 of all biotic life is found in rainforests rainforests are also responsible for 28 of the world s oxygen turnover monsoons see also monsoon and monsoon trough the equatorial region near the intertropical convergence zone itcz  or monsoon trough is the wettest portion of the world s continents annually the rain belt within the tropics marches northward by august then moves back southward into the southern hemisphere by february and march 137 within asia rainfall is favored across its southern portion from india east and northeast across the philippines and southern china into japan due to the monsoon advecting moisture primarily from the indian ocean into the region 138 the monsoon trough can reach as far north as the 40th parallel in east asia during august before moving southward thereafter its poleward progression is accelerated by the onset of the summer monsoon which is characterized by the development of lower air pressure a thermal low over the warmest part of
