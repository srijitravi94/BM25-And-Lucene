rapid intensification - wikipedia rapid intensification from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from rapid deepening jump to navigation search typhoon higos undergoing rapid intensification rapid intensification is a meteorological condition that occurs when a tropical cyclone intensifies dramatically in a short period of time the united states national hurricane center defines rapid intensification as an increase in the maximum sustained winds of a tropical cyclone of at least 30 knots 35 mph 55 km h in a 24-hour period 1 necessary conditions edit external edit in order for rapid deepening to occur several conditions must be in place water temperatures must be extremely warm near or above 30 °c 86 °f  and water of this temperature must be sufficiently deep such that waves do not churn deeper cooler waters up to the surface wind shear must be low when wind shear is high the convection and circulation in the cyclone will be disrupted internal edit usually an anticyclone in the upper layers of the troposphere above the storm must be present as well—for extremely low surface pressures to develop air must be rising very rapidly in the eyewall of the storm and an upper-level anticyclone helps channel this air away from the cyclone efficiently 2 further explanation needed hot towers have been implicated in tropical cyclone rapid intensification though diagnostically has seen varied skill across basins 3 previous nomenclature and definitions edit the united states national hurricane center previously defined rapid deepening of a tropical cyclone when the minimum central pressure decreased by 42 millibars 1.240 inhg over a 24-hour period 4 when however it is now defined as an increase in the maximum sustained winds of a tropical cyclone of at least 30 knots 35 mph 55 km h in a 24-hour period 1 the term explosive cyclogenesis has been confused with rapid intensification in the literature citation needed however due to the redefinition based on sustained wind speeds rapid intensification is being applied to tropical systems while explosive cyclogenesis and associated terms to extratropical cyclones citation needed notable instances edit

explosive deepening events ever recorded with the pressure dropping from 975 to 885 millibars as it went from a tropical storm to a category 5 super typhoon in 24 hours 5 6 in 1992, hurricane andrew was just a minimum hurricane a day before making landfall in the bahamas when it began to rapidly deepen into a category 5 hurricane right up to its landfall at peak strength it weakened significantly over the island chain but it soon hit open water again and rapidly intensified back into a category 5 hurricane just hours before making a second landfall at category 5 strength in florida 7 on september 10, 1997, hurricane linda was just a tropical storm the next day linda became a minimal hurricane by 6am on september 12, however linda s wind speeds increased to a record 185 mph the pressure dropping at an average rate of 3.38 millibars per hour 8 in 2004, hurricane charley was approaching the west coast of florida as a category two storm on the saffir-simpson scale of hurricane strength when just off the coast however its sustained winds rapidly increased from 110 to 150 mph along with a pressure drop from 965 to 941 mbar in only three hours charley caused unprecedented destruction in the punta gorda area and inflicted major damage across the state of florida 9 hurricane wilma at record intensity during 2005, hurricane wilma sustained winds rapidly intensified from 60 knots 70 mph 110 km h to 150 knots 175 mph 280 km h within 24 hours 10 as a result wilma intensified from being a tropical storm to a category 5 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale 10 over the same time span the pressure dropped from 982 millibars 29.00 inhg to 892 millibars 26.34 inhg  10 hurricane katrina and hurricane rita both rapidly intensified katrina from a category 2 to a 5, and rita from a 2 to a 5. katrina rapidly weakened as a result dropping one category every 6 hours rita kept cat 5 intensity for 24 hours before slowly weakening to a category 3 and dropping to a cat 1 just after landfall in 2006, the minimum central pressure of typhoon chebi in the western pacific dropped 75 mbar in 24 hours including a 60 mbar pressure drop in 6 hours as it intensified from a tropical storm to a category four equivalent typhoon in one advisory 11 in 2007, hurricane felix rapidly intensified from a tropical depression to a category 5 hurricane in 51 hours with a wind speed rise of 85knots 98 mph in just 24 hours 12 2008 s hurricane ike with the hurricane undergoing a 24 millibar pressure drop in 3 hours in 2010, there were multiple occurrences igor julia earl danielle and karl are prime examples each intensified from a minimal hurricane into a category 4 category 3 for karl  in 2013, typhoon usagi underwent a 55 mb drop as it had intensified from a category 1 to a category 4 super typhoon in just 24 hours typhoon lekima rapidly intensified from a category 1 to category 5 in 24 hours and most notably typhoon haiyan deepened from 35 mb within 12 hours and 965 mb to 895 mb within a day in 2014, cyclones gillian and hellen underwent rapid intensification going from tropical storms to category 5 cyclones in less than 48 hrs barely a week apart a few instances have been recorded in the north indian ocean such as the 1999 odisha cyclone the strongest storm on record in the basin undergoing a 28 millibar pressure drop in 6 hours and cyclone giri
