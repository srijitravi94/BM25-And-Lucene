is derived from the merger of four colonial settlements the settlements of newport and portsmouth were situated on what is commonly called aquidneck island today but it was called rhode island in colonial times 17 18 providence plantation was the name of the colony founded by roger williams in the area now known as the city of providence 19 this was adjoined by the settlement of warwick hence the plural providence plantations it is unclear how aquidneck island came to be known as rhode island but two historical events may have influenced the name explorer giovanni da verrazzano noted the presence of an island near the mouth of narragansett bay in 1524 which he likened to the island of rhodes part of modern greece  20 subsequent european explorers were unable to precisely identify the island that verrazzano had named but the pilgrims who later colonized the area assumed that it was aquidneck 21 adriaen block passed by aquidneck during his expeditions in the 1610s and he described it in a 1625 account of his travels as an island of reddish appearance which was een rodlich eylande in 17th-century dutch and one popular notion is that this dutch phrase might have influenced the name rhode island 22 23 historians have theorized that this reddish appearance resulted from either red autumn foliage or red clay on portions of the shore 24 verrazzano monument providence rhode island the earliest documented use of the name rhode island for aquidneck was in 1637 by roger williams the name was officially applied to the island in 1644 with these words aquethneck shall be henceforth called the isle of rodes or rhode-island the name isle of rodes is used in a legal document as late as 1646. 25 26 dutch maps as early as 1659 call the island red island roodt eylant  roger williams was a theologian who was forced out of the massachusetts bay colony seeking religious and political tolerance he and others founded providence plantation as a free proprietary colony providence referred to the concept of divine providence and plantation was an english term for a colony state of rhode island and providence plantations is the longest official name of any state in the union 2009 contestation of the name in recent years the presence of the word plantation in the state s name became a sufficiently contested issue that the general assembly voted on june 25, 2009 to hold a general referendum determining whether and providence plantations would be dropped from the official name advocates for excising plantation asserted that the word symbolized an alleged legacy of native disenfranchisement for many rhode islanders as well as the proliferation of slavery in the colonies and in the post-colonial united states rhode island abolished slavery in 1652, but the law was not enforced and by the early 18th century it was the epicenter of the north american slave trade  according to the brown daily herald 27 28 advocates for retaining the name argued that plantation was simply an archaic synonym for colony and bore no relation to slavery the referendum election was held on november 2, 2010, and the people voted overwhelmingly 78 to 22 to retain the entire original name 29 geography further information list of counties in rhode island further information geology of new england terrain map of rhode island rhode island covers an area of 1,214
