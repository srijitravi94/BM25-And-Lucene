rocket engine - wikipedia rocket engine from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article is about a type of reaction engine for rocket-propelled vehicles see rocket for reaction engines not possessing a de laval nozzle see reaction engine rs-68 being tested at nasa s stennis space center the nearly transparent exhaust is due to this engine s exhaust being mostly superheated steam water vapour from its propellants hydrogen and oxygen viking 5c rocket engine a rocket engine is a type of jet engine 1 that uses only stored rocket propellant mass for forming its high-speed propulsive jet rocket engines are reaction engines obtaining thrust in accordance with newton s third law most rocket engines are internal combustion engines although non-combusting forms such as cold gas thrusters also exist vehicles propelled by rocket engines are commonly called rockets since they need no external material to form their jet rocket engines can perform in a vacuum and thus can be used to propel spacecraft and ballistic missiles compared to other types of jet engines rocket engines are by far the lightest and have the highest thrust but are the least propellant-efficient they have the lowest specific impulse  the ideal exhaust is hydrogen the lightest of all gases but chemical rockets produce a mix of heavier species reducing the exhaust velocity rocket engines become more efficient at high velocities due to greater propulsive efficiency and the oberth effect since they do not require an atmosphere they are well suited for uses at very high altitudes and in space terminology edit here rocket is used as an abbreviation for rocket engine  thermal rockets use an inert propellant heated by a power source such as electric or nuclear power chemical rockets are powered by exothermic chemical reactions of the propellant solid-fuel rockets or solid-propellant rockets or motors are chemical rockets which use propellant in a solid state liquid-propellant rockets use one or more liquid propellants fed from tanks hybrid rockets use a solid propellant in the combustion chamber to which a second liquid or gas oxidiser or propellant is added to permit combustion monopropellant rockets use a single propellant decomposed by a catalyst the most common monopropellants are hydrazine and hydrogen peroxide principle of operation edit rocket engines produce thrust by the expulsion of an exhaust fluid which has been accelerated to a high speed through a propelling nozzle the fluid is usually a gas created by high pressure 150-to-2,900-pound-per-square-inch 10 to 200 bar combustion of solid or liquid propellants consisting of fuel and oxidiser components within a combustion chamber the nozzle uses the heat energy released by expansion of the gas to accelerate the exhaust to very high supersonic speed and the reaction to this pushes the engine in the opposite direction combustion is most frequently used for practical rockets as high temperatures and pressures are desirable for the best performance permitting a longer nozzle giving higher exhaust speeds and better thermodynamic efficiency an alternative to combustion is the water rocket which uses water pressurised by compressed air carbon dioxide nitrogen or manual pumping for model rocketry propellant edit rocket propellant is mass that is stored usually in some form of propellant tank or within the combustion chamber itself prior to being ejected from a rocket engine in the form of a fluid jet to produce thrust chemical rocket propellants are most commonly used which undergo exothermic chemical reactions which produce hot gas which is used by a rocket for propulsive purposes alternatively a chemically inert reaction mass can be heated using a high-energy power source via a heat exchanger and then no combustion chamber is used a solid rocket motor solid rocket propellants are prepared as a mixture of fuel and oxidising components called grain and the propellant storage casing effectively becomes the combustion chamber injection edit liquid-fuelled rockets force separate fuel and oxidiser components into the combustion chamber where they mix and burn hybrid rocket engines use a combination of solid and liquid or gaseous propellants both liquid and hybrid rockets use injectors to introduce the propellant into the chamber these are often an array of simple jets - holes through which the propellant escapes under pressure but sometimes may be more complex spray nozzles when two or more propellants are injected the jets usually deliberately cause the propellants to collide as this breaks up the flow into smaller droplets that burn more easily combustion chamber edit main article combustion chamber for chemical rockets the combustion chamber is typically just a cylinder and flame holders are rarely used the dimensions of the cylinder are such that the propellant is able to combust thoroughly different rocket propellants require different combustion chamber sizes for this to occur this leads to a number called l ∗ \displaystyle l l ∗ v c a t \displaystyle l \frac v c a t where v c \displaystyle v c is the volume of the chamber a t \displaystyle a t is the area of the throat l is typically in the range of 25–60 inches 0.64–1.52 m  the combination of temperatures and pressures typically reached in a combustion chamber is usually extreme by any standards unlike in airbreathing jet engines no atmospheric nitrogen is present to dilute and cool the combustion and the temperature can reach true stoichiometric ratios this in combination with the high pressures means that the rate of heat conduction through the walls is very high nozzle edit main article rocket engine nozzle rocket thrust is caused by pressures acting in the combustion chamber and nozzle from newton s third law equal and opposite pressures act on the exhaust and this accelerates it to high speeds the hot gas produced in the combustion chamber is permitted to escape through an opening the throat  and then through a diverging expansion section when sufficient pressure is provided to the nozzle about 2.5-3 times ambient pressure  the nozzle chokes and a supersonic jet is formed dramatically accelerating the gas converting most of the thermal energy into kinetic energy exhaust speeds vary depending on the expansion ratio the nozzle is designed for but exhaust speeds as high as ten times the speed of sound in air at sea level are not uncommon about half of the rocket engine s thrust comes from the unbalanced pressures inside the combustion chamber and the rest comes from the pressures acting against the inside of the nozzle see diagram  as the gas expands adiabatically the pressure against the nozzle s walls forces the rocket engine in one direction while accelerating the gas in the other the four expansion regimes of a de laval nozzle • underexpanded • perfectly expanded • overexpanded • grossly overexpanded the most commonly used nozzle is the de laval nozzle a fixed geometry nozzle with a high expansion-ratio the large bell- or cone-shaped nozzle extension beyond the throat gives the rocket engine its characteristic shape the exit static pressure of the exhaust jet depends on the chamber pressure and the ratio of exit to throat area of the nozzle as exit pressure varies from the ambient atmospheric pressure a choked nozzle is said to be underexpanded exit pressure greater than ambient  perfectly expanded exit pressure equals ambient  overexpanded exit pressure less than ambient shock diamonds form outside the nozzle  or grossly overexpanded a shock wave forms inside the nozzle extension  in practice perfect expansion is only achievable with a variable-exit area nozzle since ambient pressure decreases as altitude increases  and is not possible above a certain altitude as ambient pressure approaches zero if the nozzle is not perfectly expanded then loss of efficiency occurs grossly overexpanded nozzles lose less efficiency but can cause mechanical problems with the nozzle fixed-area nozzles become progressively more underexpanded as they gain altitude almost all de laval nozzles will be momentarily grossly overexpanded during startup in an atmosphere 2 nozzle efficiency is affected by operation in the atmosphere because atmospheric pressure changes with altitude but due to the supersonic speeds of the gas exiting from a rocket engine the pressure of the jet may be either below or above ambient and equilibrium between the two is not reached at all altitudes see diagram  back pressure and optimal expansion edit for optimal performance the pressure of the gas at the end of the nozzle should just equal the ambient pressure if the exhaust s pressure is lower than the ambient pressure then the vehicle will be slowed by the difference in pressure between the top of the engine and the exit on the other hand if the exhaust s pressure is higher then exhaust pressure that could have been converted into thrust is not converted and energy is wasted to maintain this ideal of equality between the exhaust s exit pressure and the ambient pressure the diameter of the nozzle would need to increase with altitude giving the pressure a longer nozzle to act on and reducing the exit pressure and temperature  this increase is difficult to arrange in a lightweight fashion although is routinely done with other forms of jet engines in rocketry a lightweight compromise nozzle is generally used and some reduction in atmospheric performance occurs when used at other than the design altitude or when throttled to improve on this various exotic nozzle designs such as the plug nozzle stepped nozzles the expanding nozzle and the aerospike have been proposed each providing some way to adapt to changing ambient air pressure and each allowing the gas to expand further against the nozzle giving extra thrust at higher altitudes when exhausting into a sufficiently low ambient pressure vacuum several issues arise one is the sheer weight of the nozzle—beyond a certain point for a particular vehicle the extra weight of the nozzle outweighs any performance gained secondly as the exhaust gases adiabatically expand within the nozzle they cool and eventually some of the chemicals can freeze producing snow within the jet this causes instabilities in the jet and must be avoided on a de laval nozzle exhaust gas flow detachment will occur in a grossly over-expanded nozzle as the detachment point will not be uniform around the axis of the engine a side force may be imparted to the engine this side force may change over time and result in control problems with the launch vehicle advanced altitude-compensating designs such as the aerospike or plug nozzle attempt to minimize performance losses by adjusting to varying expansion ratio caused by changing altitude propellant efficiency edit see also specific impulse typical temperature t  pressure p  and velocity v profiles in a de laval nozzle for a rocket engine to be propellant efficient it is important that the maximum pressures possible be created on the walls of the chamber and nozzle by a specific amount of propellant as this is the source of the thrust this can be achieved by all of heating the propellant to as high a temperature as possible using a high energy fuel containing hydrogen and carbon and sometimes metals such as aluminium or even using nuclear energy using a low specific density gas as hydrogen rich as possible using propellants which are or decompose to simple molecules with few degrees of freedom to maximise translational velocity since all of these things minimise the mass of the propellant used and since pressure is proportional to the mass of propellant present to be accelerated as it pushes on the engine and since from newton s third law the pressure that acts on the engine also reciprocally acts on the propellant it turns out that for any given engine the speed that the propellant leaves the chamber is unaffected by the chamber pressure although the thrust is proportional  however speed is significantly affected by all three of the above factors and the exhaust speed is an excellent measure of the engine propellant efficiency this is termed exhaust velocity and after allowance is made for factors that can reduce it the effective exhaust velocity is one of the most important parameters of a rocket engine although weight cost ease of manufacture etc are usually also very important  for aerodynamic reasons the flow goes sonic chokes at the narrowest part of the nozzle the throat  since the speed of sound in gases increases with the square root of temperature the use of hot exhaust gas greatly improves performance by comparison at room temperature the speed of sound in air is about 340 m s while the speed of sound in the hot gas of a rocket engine can be over 1700 m s much of this performance is due to the higher temperature but additionally rocket propellants are chosen to be of low molecular mass and this also gives a higher velocity compared to air expansion in the rocket nozzle then further multiplies the speed typically between 1.5 and 2 times giving a highly collimated hypersonic exhaust jet the speed increase of a rocket nozzle is mostly determined by its area expansion ratio—the ratio of the area of the throat to the area at the exit but detailed properties of the gas are also important larger ratio nozzles are more massive but are able to extract more heat from the combustion gases increasing the exhaust velocity thrust vectoring edit main article thrust vectoring vehicles typically require the overall thrust to change direction over the length of the burn a number of different ways to achieve this have been flown the entire engine is mounted on a hinge or gimbal and any propellant feeds reach the engine via low pressure flexible pipes or rotary couplings just the combustion chamber and nozzle is gimballed the pumps are fixed and high pressure feeds attach to the engine multiple engines often canted at slight angles are deployed but throttled to give the overall vector that is required giving only a very small penalty high-temperature vanes protrude into the exhaust and can be tilted to deflect the jet overall performance edit rocket technology can combine very high thrust meganewtons  very high exhaust speeds around 10 times the speed of sound in air at sea level and very high thrust weight ratios 100 simultaneously as well as being able to operate outside the atmosphere and while permitting the use of low pressure and hence lightweight tanks and structure rockets can be further optimised to even more extreme performance along one or more of these axes at the expense of the others specific impulse edit main article specific impulse isp in vacuum of various rockets rocket propellants isp vacuum s space shuttle liquid engines lox lh2 453 3 space shuttle solid motors apcp 268 3 space shuttle oms nto mmh 313 3 saturn v stage 1 lox rp-1 304 3 the most important metric for the efficiency of a rocket engine is impulse per unit of propellant this is called specific impulse usually written i s p \displaystyle i sp  this is either measured as a speed the effective exhaust velocity v e \displaystyle v e in metres second or ft s or as a time seconds  an engine that gives a large specific impulse is normally highly desirable the specific impulse that can be achieved is primarily a function of the propellant mix and ultimately would limit the specific impulse  but practical limits on chamber pressures and the nozzle expansion ratios reduce the performance that can be achieved net thrust edit main article thrust below is an approximate equation for calculating the net thrust of a rocket engine 4 f n m ˙ v e m ˙ v e − o p t a e p e − p a m b \displaystyle f n \dot m \ v e \dot m \ v e-opt a e p e -p amb where m ˙ \displaystyle \dot m exhaust gas mass flow v e \displaystyle v e effective exhaust velocity v e − o p t \displaystyle v e-opt effective jet velocity when pa pe a e \displaystyle a e flow area at nozzle exit plane or the plane where the jet leaves the nozzle if separated flow p e \displaystyle p e static pressure at nozzle exit plane p a m b \displaystyle p amb ambient or atmospheric pressure since unlike a jet engine a conventional rocket motor lacks an air intake there is no ram drag to deduct from the gross thrust consequently the net thrust of a rocket motor is equal to the gross thrust apart from static back pressure  the m ˙ v e − o p t \displaystyle \dot m \ v e-opt \ term represents the momentum thrust which remains constant at a given throttle setting whereas the a e p e − p a m b \displaystyle a e p e -p amb \ term represents the pressure thrust term at full throttle the net thrust of a rocket motor improves slightly with increasing altitude because as atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude the pressure thrust term increases at the surface of the earth the pressure thrust may be reduced by up to 30 depending on the engine design this reduction drops roughly exponentially to zero with increasing altitude maximum efficiency for a rocket engine is achieved by maximising the momentum contribution of the equation without incurring penalties from over expanding the exhaust this occurs when p e p a m b \displaystyle p e p amb  since ambient pressure changes with altitude most rocket engines spend very little time operating at peak efficiency vacuum isp edit due to the specific impulse varying with pressure a quantity that is easy to compare and calculate with is useful because rockets choke at the throat and because the supersonic exhaust prevents external pressure influences travelling upstream it turns out that the pressure at the exit is ideally exactly proportional to the propellant flow m ˙ \displaystyle \dot m  provided the mixture ratios and combustion efficiencies are maintained it is thus quite usual to rearrange the above equation slightly 5 f v a c c f m ˙ c ∗ \displaystyle f vac c f \ \dot m \,c and so define the

m ˙ \displaystyle \dot m usually measured in kg s or lb s  in liquid and hybrid rockets the propellant flow entering the chamber is controlled using valves in solid rockets it is controlled by changing the area of propellant that is burning and this can be designed into the propellant grain and hence cannot be controlled in real-time  rockets can usually be throttled down to an exit pressure of about one-third of ambient pressure 6 often limited by flow separation in nozzles and up to a maximum limit determined only by the mechanical strength of the engine in practice the degree to which rockets can be throttled varies greatly but most rockets can be throttled by a factor of 2 without great difficulty 6 the typical limitation is combustion stability as for example injectors need a minimum pressure to avoid triggering damaging oscillations chugging or combustion instabilities but injectors can be optimised and tested for wider ranges for example some more recent liquid-propellant engine designs that have been optimised for greater throttling capability can be throttled to as low as 18–20 percent of rated thrust 7 8 solid rockets can be throttled by using shaped grains that will vary their surface area over the course of the burn 6 energy efficiency edit further information rocket § energy efficiency rocket vehicle mechanical efficiency as a function of vehicle instantaneous speed divided by effective exhaust speed these percentages need to be multiplied by internal engine efficiency to get overall efficiency rocket engine nozzles are surprisingly efficient heat engines for generating a high speed jet as a consequence of the high combustion temperature and high compression ratio rocket nozzles give an excellent approximation to adiabatic expansion which is a reversible process and hence they give efficiencies which are very close to that of the carnot cycle given the temperatures reached over 60 efficiency can be achieved with chemical rockets for a vehicle employing a rocket engine the energetic efficiency is very good if the vehicle speed approaches or somewhat exceeds the exhaust velocity relative to launch but at low speeds the energy efficiency goes to 0 at zero speed as with all jet propulsion see rocket energy efficiency for more details thrust-to-weight ratio edit main article thrust-to-weight ratio rockets of all the jet engines indeed of essentially all engines have the highest thrust to weight ratio this is especially true for liquid rocket engines this high performance is due to the small volume of pressure vessels that make up the engine—the pumps pipes and combustion chambers involved the lack of inlet duct and the use of dense liquid propellant allows the pressurisation system to be small and lightweight whereas duct engines have to deal with air which has a density about one thousand times lower jet or rocket engine mass kg mass lb thrust kn thrust lbf thrust-to-weight ratio rd-0410

otherwise noted of the liquid propellants used density is worst for liquid hydrogen although this propellant is marvellous in many ways it has a very low density about one fourteenth that of water this makes the turbopumps and pipework larger and heavier and this is reflected in the thrust-to-weight ratio of engines that use it for example the ssme compared to those that do not nk-33  cooling edit for efficiency reasons and because they physically can rockets run with combustion temperatures that can reach 3,500 k 3,200 °c or 5,800 °f  most other jet engines have gas turbines in the hot exhaust due to their larger surface area they are harder to cool and hence there is a need to run the combustion processes at much lower temperatures losing efficiency in addition duct engines use air as an oxidant which contains 78 largely unreactive nitrogen which dilutes the reaction and lowers the temperatures 6 rockets have none of these inherent disadvantages therefore temperatures used in rockets are very often far higher than the melting point of the nozzle and combustion chamber materials 1,200 k for copper  two exceptions are graphite and tungsten although both are subject to oxidation if not protected indeed many construction materials can make perfectly acceptable propellants in their own right it is important that these materials be prevented from combusting melting or vaporising to the point of failure this is sometimes somewhat facetiously termed an engine-rich exhaust  materials technology could potentially place an upper limit on the exhaust temperature of chemical rockets alternatively rockets may use more common construction materials such as aluminium steel nickel or copper alloys and employ cooling systems that prevent the construction material itself becoming too hot regenerative cooling where the propellant is passed through tubes around the combustion chamber or nozzle and other techniques such as curtain cooling or film cooling are employed to give longer nozzle and chamber life these techniques ensure that a gaseous thermal boundary layer touching the material is kept below the temperature which would cause the material to catastrophically fail in rockets the heat fluxes that can pass through the wall are among the highest in engineering fluxes are generally in the range of 1-200 mw m2 the strongest heat fluxes are found at the throat which often sees twice that found in the associated chamber and nozzle this is due to the combination of high speeds which gives a very thin boundary layer  and although lower than the chamber the high temperatures seen there see rocket nozzles above for temperatures in nozzle  in rockets the coolant methods include uncooled used for short runs mainly during testing ablative walls walls are lined with a material that is continuously vaporised and carried away  radiative cooling the chamber becomes almost white hot and radiates the heat away dump cooling a propellant usually hydrogen is passed around the chamber and dumped regenerative cooling liquid rockets use the fuel or occasionally the oxidiser to cool the chamber via a cooling jacket before being injected curtain cooling propellant injection is arranged so the temperature of the gases is cooler at the walls film cooling surfaces are wetted with liquid propellant which cools as it evaporates in all cases the cooling effect that prevents the wall from being destroyed is caused by a thin layer of insulating fluid a boundary layer that is in contact with the walls that is far cooler than the combustion temperature provided this boundary layer is intact the wall will not be damaged disruption of the boundary layer may occur during cooling failures or combustion instabilities and wall failure typically occurs soon after with regenerative cooling a second boundary layer is found in the coolant channels around the chamber this boundary layer thickness needs to be as small as possible since the boundary layer acts as an insulator between the wall and the coolant this may be achieved by making the coolant velocity in the channels as high as possible in practice regenerative cooling is nearly always used in conjunction with curtain cooling and or film cooling liquid-fuelled engines are often run fuel-rich which lowers combustion temperatures this reduces heat loads on the engine and allows lower cost materials and a simplified cooling system this can also increase performance by lowering the average molecular weight of the exhaust and increasing the efficiency with which combustion heat is converted to kinetic exhaust energy mechanical issues edit rocket combustion chambers are normally operated at fairly high pressure typically 10-200 bar 1 to 20 mpa 150-3,000 psi  when operated within significant atmospheric pressure higher combustion chamber pressures give better performance by permitting a larger and more efficient nozzle to be fitted without it being grossly overexpanded however these high pressures cause the outermost part of the chamber to be under very large hoop stresses – rocket engines are pressure vessels worse due to the high temperatures created in rocket engines the materials used tend to have a significantly lowered working tensile strength in addition significant temperature gradients are set up in the walls of the chamber and nozzle these cause differential expansion of the inner liner that create internal stresses acoustic issues edit the extreme vibration and acoustic environment inside a rocket motor commonly result in peak stresses well above mean values especially in the presence of organ pipe-like resonances and gas turbulence citation needed combustion instabilities edit the combustion may display undesired instabilities of sudden or periodic nature the pressure in the injection chamber may increase until the propellant flow through the injector plate decreases a moment later the pressure drops and the flow increases injecting more propellant in the combustion chamber which burns a moment later and again increases the chamber pressure repeating the cycle this may lead to high-amplitude pressure oscillations often in ultrasonic range which may damage the motor oscillations of ±200 psi at 25 khz were the cause of failures of early versions of the titan ii missile second stage engines the other failure mode is a deflagration to detonation transition the supersonic pressure wave formed in the combustion chamber may destroy the engine 22 combustion instability was also a problem during atlas development the rocketdyne engines used in the atlas family were found to suffer from this effect in several static firing tests and three missile launches exploded on the pad due to rough combustion in the booster engines in most cases it occurred while attempting to start the engines with a dry start method whereby the igniter mechanism would be activated prior to propellant injection during the process of man-rating atlas for project mercury solving combustion instability was a high priority and the final two mercury flights sported an upgraded propulsion system with baffled injectors and a hypergolic igniter the problem affecting atlas vehicles was mainly the so-called racetrack phenomenon where burning propellant would swirl around in a circle at faster and faster speeds eventually producing vibration strong enough to rupture the engine leading to complete destruction of the rocket it was eventually solved by adding several baffles around the injector face to break up swirling propellant more significantly combustion instability was a problem with the saturn f-1 engines some of the early units tested exploded during static firing which led to the addition of injector baffles in the soviet space program combustion instability also proved a problem on some rocket engines including the rd-107 engine used in the r-7 family and the rd-216 used in the r-14 family and several failures of these vehicles occurred before the problem was solved soviet engineering and manufacturing processes never satisfactorily resolved combustion instability in larger rp-1 lox engines so the rd-171 engine used to power the zenit family still used four smaller thrust chambers fed by a common engine mechanism the combustion instabilities can be provoked by remains of cleaning solvents in the engine e.g the first attempted launch of a titan ii in 1962  reflected shock wave initial instability after ignition explosion near the nozzle that reflects into the combustion chamber and many more factors in stable engine designs the oscillations are quickly suppressed in unstable designs they persist for prolonged periods oscillation suppressors are commonly used periodic variations of thrust caused by combustion instability or longitudinal vibrations of structures between the tanks and the engines which modulate the propellant flow are known as pogo oscillations or pogo  named after the pogo stick three different types of combustion instabilities occur chugging edit this is a low frequency oscillation at a few hertz in chamber pressure usually caused by pressure variations in feed lines due to variations in acceleration of the vehicle this can cause cyclic variation in thrust and the effects can vary from merely annoying to actually damaging the payload or vehicle chugging can be minimised by using gas-filled damping tubes on feed lines of high density propellants buzzing edit this can be caused due to insufficient pressure drop across the injectors it generally is mostly annoying rather than being damaging however in extreme cases combustion can end up being forced backwards through the injectors – this can cause explosions with monopropellants screeching edit this is the most immediately damaging and the hardest to control it is due to acoustics within the combustion chamber that often couples to the chemical combustion processes that are the primary drivers of the energy release and can lead to unstable resonant screeching that commonly leads to catastrophic failure due to thinning of the insulating thermal boundary layer acoustic oscillations can be excited by thermal processes such as the flow of hot air through a pipe or combustion in a chamber specifically standing acoustic waves inside a chamber can be intensified if combustion occurs more intensely in regions where the pressure of the acoustic wave is maximal 23 24 25 26 such effects are very difficult to predict analytically during the design process and have usually been addressed by expensive time consuming and extensive testing combined with trial and error remedial correction measures screeching is often dealt with by detailed changes to injectors or changes in the propellant chemistry or vaporising the propellant before injection or use of helmholtz dampers within the combustion chambers to change the resonant modes of the chamber testing for the possibility of screeching is sometimes done by exploding small explosive charges outside the combustion chamber with a tube set tangentially to the combustion chamber near the injectors to determine the engine s impulse response and then evaluating the time response of the chamber pressure- a fast recovery indicates a stable system exhaust noise edit main article acoustic signature for all but the very smallest sizes rocket exhaust compared to other engines is generally very noisy as the hypersonic exhaust mixes with the ambient air shock waves are formed the space shuttle generates over 200 db a of noise around its base to reduce this and the risk of payload damage or injury to the crew atop the stack the mobile launcher platform was fitted with a sound suppression system that sprayed 1,100,000 litres of water around the base of the rocket in 41 seconds at launch time using this system kept sound levels within the payload bay to 142 db 27 the sound intensity from the shock waves generated depends on the size of the rocket and on the exhaust velocity such shock waves seem to account for the characteristic crackling and popping sounds produced by large rocket engines when heard live these noise peaks typically overload microphones and audio electronics and so are generally weakened or entirely absent in recorded or broadcast audio reproductions for large rockets at close range the acoustic effects could actually kill 28 more worryingly for space agencies such sound levels can also damage the launch structure or worse be reflected back at the comparatively delicate rocket above this is why so much water is typically used at launches the water spray changes the acoustic qualities of the air and reduces or deflects the sound energy away from the rocket generally speaking noise is most intense when a rocket is close to the ground since the noise from the engines radiates up away from the jet as well as reflecting off the ground also when the vehicle is moving slowly little of the chemical energy input to the engine can go into increasing the kinetic energy of the rocket since useful power p transmitted to the vehicle is p f ∗ v \displaystyle p f v for thrust f and speed v  then the largest portion of the energy is dissipated in the exhaust s interaction with the ambient air producing noise this noise can be reduced somewhat by flame trenches with roofs by water injection around the jet and by deflecting the jet at an angle testing edit rocket engines are usually statically tested at a test facility before being put into production for high altitude engines either a shorter nozzle must be used or the rocket must be tested in a large vacuum chamber safety edit rocket vehicles have a reputation for unreliability and danger especially catastrophic failures contrary to this reputation carefully designed rockets can be made arbitrarily reliable citation needed in military use rockets are not unreliable however one of the main non-military uses of rockets is for orbital launch in this application the premium has typically been placed on minimum weight and it is difficult to achieve high reliability and low weight simultaneously in addition if the number of flights launched is low there is a very high chance of a design operations or manufacturing error causing destruction of the vehicle citation needed essentially all launch vehicles are test vehicles by normal aerospace standards as of 2016 update  original research saturn family 1961-1975 edit the rocketdyne h-1 engine used in a cluster of eight in the first stage of the saturn i and

booster used in pairs caused one notable catastrophic failure in 270 engine-flights the space shuttle main engine used in a cluster of three flew in 46 refurbished engine units these made a total of 405 engine-flights with no catastrophic in-flight failures a single in-flight ssme failure occurring during space shuttle challenger s sts-51-f mission 30 resulting in a 99.95 reliability rate 31 this failure had no effect on mission objectives or duration 32 chemistry edit rocket propellants require a high specific energy energy per unit mass  because ideally all the reaction energy appears as kinetic energy of the exhaust gases and exhaust velocity is the single most important performance parameter of an engine on which vehicle performance depends aside from inevitable losses and imperfections in the engine incomplete combustion etc. after specific reaction energy the main theoretical limit reducing the exhaust velocity obtained is that according to the laws of thermodynamics a fraction of the chemical energy may go into rotation of the exhaust molecules where it is unavailable for producing thrust monatomic gases like helium have only three degrees of freedom corresponding to the three dimensions of space x,y,z  and only such spherically symmetric molecules escape this kind of loss a diatomic molecule like h2 can rotate about either of the two axes perpendicular to the one joining the two atoms and as the equipartition law of statistical mechanics demands that the available thermal energy be divided equally among the degrees of freedom for such a gas in thermal equilibrium 3 5 of the energy can go into unidirectional motion and 2 5 into rotation actually the vibration of the molecule should not be neglected see gas heat capacity  a triatomic molecule like water has six degrees of freedom so the energy is divided equally among rotational and translational degrees of freedom for most chemical reactions the latter situation is the case this issue is traditionally described in terms of the ratio gamma of the specific heat of the gas at constant volume to that at constant pressure the rotational energy loss is largely recovered in practice if the expansion nozzle is large enough to allow the gases to expand and cool sufficiently the function of the nozzle being to convert the random thermal motions of the molecules in the combustion chamber into the unidirectional translation that produces thrust as long as the exhaust gas remains in equilibrium as it expands the initial rotational energy will be largely returned to translation in the nozzle although the specific reaction energy per unit mass of reactants is key low mean molecular weight in the reaction products is also important in practice in determining exhaust velocity this is because the high gas temperatures in rocket engines pose serious problems for the engineering of survivable motors because temperature is proportional to the mean energy per molecule a given amount of energy distributed among more molecules of lower mass permits a higher exhaust velocity at a given temperature this means low atomic mass elements are favoured liquid hydrogen lh2 and oxygen lox or lo2  are the most effective propellants in terms of exhaust velocity that have been widely used to date though a few exotic combinations involving boron or liquid ozone are potentially somewhat better in theory if various practical problems could be solved 33 it is important to note in computing the specific reaction energy that the entire mass of the propellants including both fuel and oxidiser must be included the fact that air-breathing engines are typically able to obtain oxygen for free without having to carry it along accounts for one factor of why air-breathing engines are very much more propellant-mass efficient and one reason that rocket engines are far less suitable for most ordinary terrestrial applications fuels for car or turbojet engines use atmospheric oxygen and so have a much better effective energy output per unit mass of propellant that must be carried but are similar per unit mass of fuel computer programs that predict the performance of propellants in rocket engines are available 34 35 36 ignition edit further information combustion with liquid and hybrid rockets immediate ignition of the propellant s as they first enter the combustion chamber is essential with liquid propellants but not gaseous  failure to ignite within milliseconds usually causes too much liquid propellant to be inside the chamber and if when ignition occurs the amount of hot gas created can exceed the maximum design pressure of the chamber causing a catastrophic failure of the pressure vessel this is sometimes called a hard start or a rapid unscheduled disassembly rud  37 ignition can be achieved by a number of different methods a pyrotechnic charge can be used a plasma torch can be used citation needed or electric spark ignition 38 may be employed some fuel oxidiser combinations ignite on contact hypergolic  and non-hypergolic fuels can be chemically ignited by priming the fuel lines with hypergolic propellants popular in russian engines  gaseous propellants generally will not cause hard starts with rockets the total injector area is less than the throat thus the chamber pressure tends to ambient prior to ignition and high pressures cannot form even if the entire chamber is full of flammable gas at ignition solid propellants are usually ignited with one-shot pyrotechnic devices 6 once ignited rocket chambers are self-sustaining and igniters are not needed indeed chambers often spontaneously reignite if they are restarted after being shut down for a few seconds however when cooled many rockets cannot be restarted without at least minor maintenance such as replacement of the pyrotechnic igniter 6 jet physics edit armadillo aerospace s quad vehicle showing visible banding shock diamonds in the exhaust jet rocket jets vary depending on the rocket engine design altitude altitude thrust and other factors carbon rich exhausts from kerosene fuels are often orange in colour due to the black body radiation of the unburnt particles in addition to the blue swan bands peroxide oxidizer-based rockets and hydrogen rocket jets contain largely steam and are nearly invisible to the naked eye but shine brightly in the ultraviolet and infrared jets from solid rockets can be highly visible as the propellant frequently contains metals such as elemental aluminium which burns with an orange-white flame and adds energy to the combustion process some exhausts notably alcohol fuelled rockets can show visible shock diamonds these are due to cyclic variations in the jet pressure relative to ambient creating shock waves that form mach disks  the shape of the jet varies from the design altitude at high altitude all rockets are grossly under-expanded and a quite small percentage of exhaust gases actually end up expanding forwards types of rocket engines edit physically powered edit type description advantages disadvantages water rocket partially filled pressurised carbonated drinks container with tail and

disastrous results grain cracks burn and widen during burn refueling harder than simply filling tanks hybrid rocket separate oxidiser fuel typically the oxidiser is liquid and kept in a tank and the fuel is solid quite simple solid fuel is essentially inert without oxidiser safer cracks do not escalate throttleable and easy to switch off some oxidisers are monopropellants can explode in own right mechanical failure of solid propellant can block nozzle very rare with rubberised propellant  central hole widens over burn and negatively affects mixture ratio monopropellant rocket propellant such as hydrazine hydrogen peroxide or nitrous oxide flows over a catalyst and exothermically decomposes hot gases are emitted through nozzle simple in concept throttleable low temperatures in combustion chamber catalysts can be easily contaminated monopropellants can detonate if contaminated or provoked isp is perhaps 1 3 of best liquids bipropellant rocket two fluid typically liquid propellants are introduced through injectors into combustion chamber and burnt up to 99 efficient combustion with excellent mixture control throttleable can be used with turbopumps which permits incredibly lightweight tanks can be safe with extreme care pumps needed for high performance are expensive to design huge thermal fluxes across combustion chamber wall can impact reuse failure modes include major explosions a lot of plumbing is needed dual mode propulsion rocket rocket takes off as a bipropellant rocket then turns to using just one propellant as a monopropellant simplicity and ease of control lower performance than bipropellants tripropellant rocket three different propellants usually hydrogen hydrocarbon and liquid oxygen are introduced into a combustion chamber in variable mixture ratios or multiple engines are used with fixed propellant mixture ratios and throttled or shut down reduces take-off weight since hydrogen is lighter combines good thrust to weight with high average isp improves payload for launching from earth by a sizeable percentage similar issues to bipropellant but with more plumbing more research and development air-augmented rocket essentially a

in a tank at high temperature pressure and turns to steam in nozzle simple fairly safe under 200 seconds isp low overall performance due to heavy tank solar thermal edit the solar thermal rocket would make use of solar power to directly heat reaction mass and therefore does not require an electrical generator as most other forms of solar-powered propulsion do a solar thermal rocket only has to carry the means of capturing solar energy such as concentrators and mirrors the heated propellant is fed through a conventional rocket nozzle to produce thrust the engine thrust is directly related to the surface area of the solar collector and to the local intensity of the solar radiation and inversely proportional to the isp type description advantages disadvantages solar thermal rocket

stationkeeping and attitude control 39 only useful once in space as thrust is fairly low but hydrogen has not been traditionally thought to be easily stored in space 39 otherwise moderate low isp if higher–molecular-mass propellants are used using higher–molecular-weight propellants for example water lowers performance see also ion thruster beamed thermal edit type description advantages disadvantages light beam powered rocket propellant is heated by light beam often laser aimed at vehicle from a distance either directly or indirectly via heat exchanger simple in principle in principle very high exhaust speeds can be achieved 1 mw of power per kg of payload is needed to achieve orbit relatively high accelerations lasers are blocked by clouds fog reflected laser light may be dangerous pretty much needs hydrogen monopropellant for good performance which needs heavy tankage some designs are limited to 600 seconds due to reemission of light since propellant heat exchanger gets white hot microwave beam powered rocket propellant is heated by microwave beam aimed at vehicle from a distance isp is comparable to nuclear thermal rocket combined with t w comparable to conventional rocket while lh2 propellant offers the highest isp and rocket payload fraction ammonia or methane are economically superior for earth-to-orbit rockets due to their particular combination of high density and isp ssto operation is possible with these propellants even for small rockets so there are no location trajectory and shock constraints added by the rocket staging process microwaves are 10x-100x cheaper in watt than lasers and have all-weather operation at frequencies below 10 ghz 0.3-3 mw of power per kg of payload is needed to achieve orbit depending on the propellant 40 and this incurs infrastructure cost for the beam director plus related r d costs concepts operating in the millimeter-wave region have to contend with weather availability and high altitude beam director sites as well as effective transmitter diameters measuring 30-300 meters to propel a vehicle to leo concepts operating in x-band or below must have effective transmitter diameters measured in kilometers to achieve a fine enough beam to follow a vehicle to leo the transmitters are too large to fit on mobile platforms and so microwave-powered rockets are constrained to launch near fixed beam director sites nuclear thermal edit type description advantages disadvantages radioisotope rocket poodle thruster radioactive decay energy heat from radioactive decay is used to

production and handling energy losses in neutrinos gamma rays muons thermal issues theoretical only at this point history of rocket engines edit according to the writings of the roman aulus gellius in c 400 bc a greek pythagorean named archytas propelled a wooden bird along wires using steam 41 however it would not appear to have been powerful enough to take off under its own thrust the aeolipile described in the first century bc often known as hero s engine essentially consists of a steam rocket on a bearing it was created almost two millennia before the industrial revolution but the principles behind it were not well understood and its full potential was not realised for a millennium the availability of black powder to propel projectiles was a precursor to the development of the first solid rocket ninth century chinese taoist alchemists discovered black powder in a search for the elixir of life this accidental discovery led to fire arrows which were the first rocket engines to leave the ground it is stated that the reactive forces of incendiaries were probably not applied to the propulsion of projectiles prior to the 13th century  a turning point in rocket technology emerged with a short manuscript entitled liber ignium ad comburendos hostes abbreviated as the book of fires  the manuscript is composed of recipes for creating incendiary weapons from the mid-eighth to the end of the thirteenth centuries—two of which are rockets the first recipe calls for one part of colophonium and sulfur added to six parts of saltpeter potassium nitrate dissolved in laurel oil then inserted into hollow wood and lit to fly away suddenly to whatever place you wish and burn up everything  the second recipe combines one pound of sulfur two pounds of charcoal and six pounds of saltpeter—all finely powdered on a marble slab this powder mixture is packed firmly into a long and narrow case the introduction of saltpeter into pyrotechnic mixtures connected the shift from hurled greek fire into self-propelled rocketry  42 articles and books on the subject of rocketry appeared increasingly from the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries in the sixteenth century german military engineer conrad haas 1509-1576 wrote a manuscript which introduced the construction to multi-staged rockets 43 rocket engines were also brought in use by tippu sultan the king of mysore these rockets could be of various sizes but usually consisted of a tube of soft hammered iron about 8 in 20 cm long and 1 1⁄2–3 in 3.8–7.6 cm diameter closed at one end and strapped to a shaft of bamboo about 4 ft 120 cm long the iron tube acted as a combustion chamber and contained well packed black powder propellant a rocket carrying about one pound of powder could travel almost 1,000 yards 910 m  these rockets  fitted with swords used to travel long distance several meters above in air before coming down with swords edges facing the enemy these rockets were used against british empire very effectively slow development of this technology continued up to the later 19th century when russian konstantin tsiolkovsky first wrote about liquid-fueled rocket engines he was the first to develop the tsiolkovsky rocket equation though it was not published widely for some years the modern solid- and liquid-fueled engines became realities early in the 20th century thanks to the american physicist robert goddard goddard was the first to use a de laval nozzle on a solid-propellant gunpowder rocket engine doubling the thrust and increasing the efficiency by a factor of about twenty-five this was the birth of the modern rocket engine he calculated from his independently-derived rocket equation that a reasonably sized rocket using solid fuel could place a one-pound payload on the moon he began to use liquid propellants in 1921 and was the first to launch in 1926, a liquid-propellant rocket goddard pioneered the use of the de laval nozzle lightweight propellant tanks thrust vectoring the smoothly-throttled liquid fuel engine regenerative cooling and curtain cooling 6 247–266 during the late 1930s german scientists such as wernher von braun and hellmuth walter investigated installing liquid-fueled rockets in military aircraft heinkel he 112, he 111, he 176 and messerschmitt me 163  44 the turbopump was first employed by german scientists in wwii until then cooling the nozzle had been problematic and the a4 ballistic missile used dilute alcohol for the fuel which reduced the combustion temperature sufficiently staged combustion замкнутая схема was first proposed by alexey isaev in 1949. the first staged combustion engine was the s1.5400 used in the soviet planetary rocket designed by melnikov a former assistant to isaev 6 about the same time 1959  nikolai kuznetsov began work on the closed cycle engine nk-9 for korolev s orbital icbm gr-1 kuznetsov later evolved that design into the nk-15 and nk-33 engines for the unsuccessful lunar n1 rocket in the west the first laboratory staged-combustion test engine was built in germany in 1963, by ludwig boelkow hydrogen peroxide kerosene fueled engines such as the british gamma of the 1950s used a closed-cycle process arguably not staged combustion but that s mostly a question of semantics by catalytically decomposing the peroxide to drive turbines before combustion with the kerosene in the combustion chamber proper this gave the efficiency advantages of staged combustion whilst avoiding the major engineering problems liquid hydrogen engines were first successfully developed in america the rl-10 engine first flew in 1962. hydrogen engines were used as part of the apollo program the liquid hydrogen fuel giving a rather lower stage mass and thus reducing the overall size and cost of the vehicle
