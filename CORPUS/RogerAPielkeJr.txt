edit pielke s early work was on the space shuttle program in 1993 he argued that the shuttle was expensive and risky - that it was probable that another orbiter would be lost within 20-35 flights 7 shortly before the loss of columbia he warned that loss of another shuttle was only a matter of time 8 he has also been critical of the space station program 9 pielke has also written extensively on climate change policy he has written that he accepts the ipcc view of the underlying science stating the ipcc has concluded that greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activity are an important driver of changes in climate and on this basis alone i am personally convinced that it makes sense to take action to limit greenhouse gas emissions 10 he also states that any conceivable emissions reductions policies even if successful cannot have a perceptible impact on the climate for many decades  and from this he concludes that in coming decades the only policies that can effectively be used to manage the immediate effects of climate variability and change will be adaptive 11 12 on the issues of hurricanes and climate change he has argued that the trend in increasing damage from hurricanes is primarily due to societal and economic factors chiefly an increase in wealth density  rather than change in the frequency and intensity 13 pielke has been labeled a skeptic and denier of climate change though pielke strongly objects to those labels 14 his views on climate change have been widely criticized by scientists including us presidential science adviser john holdren 15 16 pielke rejected holdren s criticisms saying the facts are on my side  17 and several publications defended pielke 18 19 in october 2016, in a hacked email disclosed by wikileaks 20 judd legum the editor of thinkprogress a site that is part of the center for american progress action fund states that a thinkprogress blog helped to discredit roger pielke jr and get him fired from the fivethirtyeight website 21 but the huffington post reported on this in 2014. 22 fivethirtyeight published a pielke article in march 2014 23 that climate scientists michael mann and kevin trenberth criticized as deeply misleading and demonstrably wrong in interviews with thinkprogress 24 the scientists said that pielke sent them threatening e-mails in response to their criticism calling it libelous pielke responded that their characterization of his e-mails as threatening was ridiculous  legum told the huffington post that he contacted nate silver the editor of fivethirtyeight which apologized to the two scientists for pielke s behavior 22 other criticisms of pielke s article followed 25 the guardian published an article by dana nuccitelli called fivethirtyeight undermines its brand by misrepresenting climate research  26 and john abraham wrote that pielke s conclusions are not taken seriously by myself and other climate scientists 27 in april 2015, pielke joined with a group of scholars in issuing an ecomodernist manifesto 28 29 the other authors were john asafu-adjaye linus blomqvist stewart brand barry brook ruth defries erle ellis christopher foreman david keith

democratic member of the united states house committee on natural resources raúl grijalva sent a letter to university of colorado president bruce d benson requesting information on the sources of funding for and communications related to pielke s research and congressional testimony the letter was one of seven grijalva sent to various institutions stemming from concerns about the influence of funding from fossil fuel companies on the work and testimony of harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics researcher willie soon pielke responded that he has no funding from fossil fuel interests and characterized the letter as part of a politically motivated witch-hunt  31 in response to criticism that requesting communications was counter to principles of academic freedom grijalva said he was willing to eliminate that part of the request 32 the heads of some mainstream scientific organizations criticized grijalva’s letters margaret leinen the president of the american geophysical union posted in her agu blog that in requiring information only of a few scientists based only on their scientific views grivalja’s action was contrary to academic freedom “we view the singling out of any individual or group of scientists by any entity – governmental corporate or other – based solely on their interpretations of scientific research as a threat to that freedom.” 33 the executive director of the american meteorological society wrote in a letter to grvalja that his action “sends a chilling message to all academic researchers,” and “impinges on the free pursuit of ideas that is central to the concept of academic freedom.” 34 conservative columnist rich lowry editor of the national review noted in an opinion piece that it’s not that he pielke doubts climate change or even doubts that it could be harmful his offense is merely pointing to data showing that extreme weather events like hurricanes tornadoes and droughts haven’t yet been affected by climate change this is enough to enrage advocates who need immediate disasters as a handy political cudgel 35 pielke was also named in a letter sent by senator edward markey d–ma to numerous energy industry groups asking them to disclose the names of scientists they had funded regarding conflict of interest disclosures pielke said that if you look at our community the failure to disclose conflicts of interest is fairly
