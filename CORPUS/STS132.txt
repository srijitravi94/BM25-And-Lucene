astronauts took a tour of the kennedy space center and viewed the launch of atlantis 28 mission experiments edit atlantis crew worked with several short-term experiments during their mission the shuttle transported new long-term experiments to the iss at the end of the mission atlantis returned some of the completed experiments from the iss short-term experiments included micro-2 researchers from rensselaer polytechnic institute sent microorganisms to investigate new ways of preventing the formation and spread of clusters of bacteria biofilms  that could pose a threat to the health of astronauts 29 after the shuttle landed the resulting biofilms were examined to see how their growth and development were impacted by microgravity hypersole hypersole is a canadian research project that plans to investigate sudden changes in skin sensitivity experienced by some astronauts in space 30 the researchers hope to understand more about how the skin sensitivity of the soles of the feet affect the human balance three sts-132 crew members participated in identical trials before the launch and immediately upon landing the trials were also repeated on five astronauts scheduled to fly on the sts-133 and sts-134 missions project findings are expected to add significant knowledge to existing studies of aging and to be beneficial for the elderly and people who suffer from balance problems shuttle ionospheric modification with pulsed localized exhaust experiments simplex – sts-132 crew performed the simplex burn on flight day 12. the experiment investigates plasma turbulence driven by shuttle exhaust in the ionosphere using ground-based radars 31 the processes by which chemical releases can produce plasma turbulence are quantified with the simplex measurements plasma turbulence can affect military navigation and communications using radio systems they can also be used to promote communications by opening radio channels at abnormally high frequencies shuttle processing edit the mission s external tank et-136 began its 900-mile 1,400 km  six-day journey across the gulf of mexico from nasa s michoud assembly facility in new orleans louisiana on 24 february 2010. 32 33 et-136 measured 154 feet 47 m long and 28 feet 8.5 m in diameter the solid rocket booster retrieval ship liberty star towed the et in the enclosed barge pegasus after docking in the turn basin at the kennedy space center the tank was offloaded and driven to the vehicle assembly building vab on 1 march 2010. 34 on 29 march 2010, workers attached et-136 to its solid rocket boosters a crane lifted the et into high bay no 1 inside the vab the day-long process was completed around 18 00 edt as the tank was bolted to atlantis s twin solid rocket boosters 35 atlantis rolled out of its processing bay opf-1 around 07 00 edt on 13 april 2010. the shuttle entered the vab around 11 00 edt for attachment to its external tank and solid rocket boosters 36 given that this was at the time believed to be atlantis final rollover for a mission the shuttle stopped for several hours en route to the vab allowing engineers and technicians to pose for photographs with the orbiter 37 the rollover occurred exactly 25 years after atlantis first arrived at the kennedy space center after a cross-country trip from the shuttle factory in palmdale california 38 the path to the rollover was without any incidents of major concern with only 22 interim problem reports iprs noted during atlantis flow since its return from the sts-129 mission in november 2009. the transport canister containing the sts-132 payload arrived at pad 39a on 15 april 2010 ahead of atlantis rollover to the launch pad 39 the canister was shaped like the shuttle s 60-foot 18 m -long payload bay packed inside it were the mrm-1 module and the cargo-carrying pallet icc-vld space shuttle atlantis began its rollout to launch pad 39a at 23 31 edt on 21 april 2010. 40 the complete shuttle stack and mobile launch platform were secured to the launch pad s structure at 6 03 edt on 22 april 2010. the 3.4 mi 5.5 kilometres 3.4 mi trek took 6 hours and 32 minutes to complete the rollout was originally planned for the evening of 19 april 2010, but wet weather and thunderstorms on the space coast caused several delays 41 42 sts-132 s payload was installed in the shuttle s cargo bay on 25 april 2010. 43 pad engineers preparing atlantis had noticed paint peeling from shuttle s main payload the mrm-1 module although the problem was declared to have no impact on the operation of mrm-1 it holds a potential threat of releasing debris on orbit 44 engineers also noted mrm-1 cycled its fire and smoke detector self test several times similar events occurred during atlantis sts-129 mission in november 2009 when shuttle and station crew were awakened consecutive nights by false depressurization and fire alarms that originated from the mrm-2 poisk module an agency-wide flight readiness review frr was held at ksc in florida on 5 may 2010 to discuss atlantis launch preparations at the end of the review top nasa managers made the decision to officially set the launch for 14 may 2010 at 14 20 edt 45 46 nasa held a post news conference to brief about the results of the frr the briefing was broadcast on nasa tv and was attended by nasa s associate administrator for space operations william gerstenmaier space shuttle program manager john shannon and space shuttle launch director michael leinbach mr shannon mentioned that firstly ceramic inserts around atlantis windows and forward rocket pod were tested after an insert loosened during discovery s re-entry on sts-131 posing a potential impact threat the inserts had been re-installed on to atlantis using a thicker braided cord to reduce the chances of a backing out secondly it was mentioned that engineers had reviewed work to confirm that all systems on atlantis ku band antenna were in place the testing had been provoked after the failure of that communication system during sts-131 mr leinbach also acknowledged the skills and experience of the engineering teams and thanked the engineers who had successfully resolved hypergolic loading issues 47 hypergolics are chemicals that ignite when they come in contact with each other the propellants are used in the reaction control system that steers the shuttle in space a booster rocket segment that had first flown 25 years before on atlantis maiden flight sts-51-j was used to help fly sts-132 48 the aft dome on the left solid rocket booster that lifted off to support atlantis sts-132 mission first launched sts-51-j on 3 october 1985. including sts-132 18 of atlantis 32 flights were represented by the boosters segments launch preparations edit atlantis astronauts traveled from johnson space center houston to the ksc launch site on 10 may 2010 to prepare for the launch the crew arriving in four northrop t-38 talon jets landed on the shuttle landing facility around 18 49 edt 49 the official countdown to liftoff started on 11 may 2010 after the countdown clocks at ksc were activated at 16 00 edt ticking backward from the t-43 hour mark program managers completed the l-2 mission management team mmt meeting on 12 may 2010. 50 at the end of the 18-minute-long meeting management team officially cleared atlantis for launch nasa held a pre-launch news conference to reveal the outcomes of the mmt and to brief the press on the upcoming launch the news conference was attended by chair pre-launch mission management team mike moses mike leinbach and sts-132 weather officer todd mcnamara the weather officer spoke of a favorable launch weather forecast due to a high pressure weather pattern and despite a low cloud ceiling calling a 70 percent chance of favorable conditions at launch time he further elaborated on the predicted weather conditions at the transoceanic abort landing tal sites zaragoza and moron in spain and istres france in case of an emergency the space shuttle program mmt met at 04 15 edt on 14 may 2010 and gave a go to begin loading atlantis et with liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen the fuel tanking operation began on time at 04 55 edt and was completed within three hours at 07 56 edt with replenishment fuel being added throughout the countdown crew preparations for the launch day began at 05 00 edt following an eight-hour overnight sleep an hour later they completed their final medical check ups crew suiting began around 10 00 edt and the astronauts departed for the launch pad at 10 30 edt at around 11 00 edt first commander ham ingressed the shuttle first and strapped into his seat followed by pilot antonelli mission specialists bowen sellers reisman and good in order inside the orbiter all six astronauts performed checks with ground controllers to verify that communications links work properly with all astronauts on board atlantis hatch was closed and latched for the flight inside the white room the closeout crew finished their job by pressurizing the crew cabin and checking for leaks before leaving the pad launch day countdown procedures went without any major problems however atlantis encountered two minor issues the final inspection team looking for ice and frost buildup on the et had spotted a small stress fracture on an umbilical strut later during the post-launch news conference the chair of nasa s pre-launch mission management team mike moses said that this was not unusual engineers also resolved any concerns about a loose ball bearing found near the shuttle s payload bay days earlier the bearing was determined to likely be from a camera system and was ultimately ruled out as a concern mission timeline edit 14 may flight day 1 – launch edit play media the

present at ksc 56 once in orbit the crew opened the shuttle s payload bay doors activated the radiators and deployed the ku band antenna successfully they also completed a checkout of the orbiter s shuttle remote manipulator system srms  the crew was also successful in downlinking all imagery from atlantis umbilical well cameras along with crew video of et-136 for review by imagery experts in the ground 57 preliminary inspections showed that et-136 was very clean and had performed well during the ascent with only a few foam liberation incidents visible it is worth noting that the launch of atlantis on sts-132 was supposed to be its last the mission patch depicted atlantis flying into the sunset as she retired and the space shuttle program patches on sale at the kennedy space center for the launch showed the years 1981–2010 for the program the programme guide magazine to the launch also cited the launch as the final flight of space shuttle atlantis however on its return atlantis was readied as a rescue shuttle for the at that time two remaining missions of sts-133 and sts-134 it could be launched on need if there was a problem and if not it would be stood down then later in 2010, nasa decided to fly the previously provision sts-135 mission and chose atlantis for the flight given that discover and endeavour were earmarked for sts-133 and sts-134 respectively the funding was found and a decision was taken to fly sts-135 as the final space shuttle mission with atlantis as the orbiter the sts-135 mission launched in july 2011, just over a year after atlantis s launch on the sts-132 mission 15 may flight day 2 – tps survey edit atlantis cargo bay and its vertical stabilizer the crew members aboard atlantis began their first full day in space at 08 20 utc 58 the day was primarily devoted to inspecting atlantis s thermal protection system using the shuttle s robotic arm and the orbiter boom sensor system obss to look for any signs of launch damage before the thermal protection checkout began the crew encountered a problem with the laser dynamic range imager ldri and the intensified tv camera itvc  due to a snagged cable in that system s pan and tilt unit 59 as a result mission control decided to switch to the less-capable backup sensor system sensor package 2, a laser camera and a digital camera mounted near the end of the obss sensor package 2 required an additional light source such as daylight  had a resolution of a few millimeters and could scan at about 2.5 inches per second 60 the crew followed late inspection procedures for surveying and images

him during atlantis approach to the iss down on the shuttle s middeck good and bowen spent several hours checking out spacesuits and preparing them for transfer to the station reisman spent much of his day working with antonelli and ham on the tps survey he also assisted with the suit and spacewalk equipment checkouts the crew furthermore performed the ods ring extension that would connect the shuttle s docking port to the station s harmony module the last portion of the crew s day was spent preparing and checking out all of the tools to be used during the rendezvous two course correction burns were also performed on flight day 2. the first 10-second burn dubbed nc-2 was performed using the right-hand oms engine changing the shuttle s speed by 8 ft s 2.4 m s  the burn raised both the apogee and perigee of the shuttle s orbit by 1-mile 1.6 km  atlantis reaction control jets were again fired for a second time to execute the 8-second nc-3 burn which changed the shuttle s velocity by about 2 ft s 0.61 m s  meanwhile mission control managers determined that the iss would not need an avoidance maneuver to avoid a piece of orbital debris updated tracking information showed that the

intravehicular officer to assist during the spacewalk mission specialist sellers and station flight engineer caldwell dyson operated the robotic arm 68 throughout eva 1, commander ken ham oversaw the extravehicular activities during the spacewalk several problems were encountered 69 the first of which was during installation of the sgant a slight gap was observed between the antenna dish and its mounting pole the spacewalkers loosened the bolts and used a higher torque setting which managed to close the gap to a smaller width the launch locks were left on the sgant to allow engineers on the ground to determine if the gap was acceptable or if more troubleshooting would be needed the second problem occurred during the installation of the sgant and was related to the command and control cnc computers 70 during installation when steve bowen removed a cover from a connector the prime cnc computer detected an error and shut down the cap was a special cap which allowed the circuit for that connector to be closed so when it was opened the sensor detected an error the shut down of the cnc caused a 2-minute loss of communications the safeing of the computer also stopped the canadarm2 for a reconfiguration of the cameras being used during the spacewalk by both the robotic arm operators and observers on the ground 71 the spacewalk ended at 19 19 utc after reisman and bowen made an

standard post-flight inspection of atlantis a united space alliance inspector found a sts-132 mission decal accompanied by an inscription the first last flight of atlantis left earth on 14 may 2010 from pad 39a together with the crew s signatures 103 104 the worker had found it tucked away on the upper side of locker a-16 while scanning the area with a mirror moreover he said the note must have been written in orbit since otherwise the author would have had to stand on their head to write it at the time the note was written sts-132 was indeed the last planned mission of atlantis however one further mission was ultimately approved for the shuttle sts-135 which will be the last flight of both atlantis and the space shuttle program wake-up calls edit nasa began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the gemini program and first used music to wake up a flight crew during apollo 15. each track is specially chosen often by the astronauts families and usually has a special
