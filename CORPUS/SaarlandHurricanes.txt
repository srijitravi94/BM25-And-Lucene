round the team lost both games to the munich cowboys and found itself back in the 2nd bundesliga 2 in this league soon to be renamed german football league 2, the saarland hurricanes took two seasons to rebuild before another division title in 2010 meant direct promotion back to the gfl courtesy to a league expansion 2 the club was only able to win two of their regular season games in 2011 and finished second-last in the gfl south avoiding relegation because of an even worse performance by the plattling black hawks 3 in 2012, the club came seventh in the southern division of the gfl and
