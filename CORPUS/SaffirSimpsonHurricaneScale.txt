saffir–simpson hurricane scale sshs  classifies hurricanes – western hemisphere tropical cyclones that exceed the intensities of tropical depressions and tropical storms – into five categories distinguished by the intensities of their sustained winds to be classified as a hurricane a tropical cyclone must have maximum sustained winds of at least 74 mph 33 m s 64 kn 119 km h category 1  the highest classification in the scale category 5, consists of storms with sustained winds exceeding 156 mph 70 m s 136 kn 251 km h  the classifications can provide some indication of the potential damage and flooding a hurricane will cause upon landfall officially the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale is used only to describe hurricanes forming in the atlantic ocean and northern pacific ocean east of the international date line other areas use different scales to label these storms which are called cyclones or typhoons  depending on the area there is some criticism of the sshs for not taking rain storm surge and other important factors into consideration but sshs defenders say that part of the goal of sshs is to be straightforward and simple to understand history edit the scale was developed in 1971 by civil engineer herbert saffir and meteorologist robert simpson who at the time was director of the u.s national hurricane center nhc  1 the scale was introduced to the general public in 1973, 2 and saw widespread use after neil frank replaced simpson at the helm of the nhc in 1974. 3 the initial scale was developed by saffir a structural engineer who in 1969 went on commission for the united nations to study low-cost housing in hurricane-prone areas 4 while performing the study saffir realized there was no simple scale for describing the likely effects of a hurricane mirroring the utility of the richter magnitude scale in describing earthquakes he devised a 1–5 scale based on wind speed that showed expected damage to structures saffir gave the scale to the nhc and simpson added the effects of storm surge and flooding in 2009, the nhc made moves to eliminate pressure and storm surge ranges from the categories transforming it into a pure wind scale called the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale experimental sshws  5 the new scale became operational on may 15, 2010. 6 the scale excludes flood ranges storm surge estimations rainfall and location which means a category 2 hurricane which hits a major city will likely do far more cumulative damage than a category 5 hurricane that hits a rural area 7 the agency cited various hurricanes as reasons for removing the scientifically inaccurate information including hurricane katrina 2005 and hurricane ike 2008  which both had stronger than estimated storm surges and hurricane charley 2004  which had weaker than estimated storm surge 8 since removed from the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale storm surge predicting and modeling is now handled with the use of a computerized numerical model developed by the national weather service called sea lake and overland surge from hurricanes slosh  in 2012, the nhc expanded the windspeed range for category 4 by 1 mph in both directions to 130–156 mph with corresponding changes in the other units 113–136 kn 209–251 km h  instead of 131–155 mph 114–135 kn 210–249 km h  the nhc and the central pacific hurricane center assign tropical cyclone intensities in 5 knot increments and then convert to mph and km h with a similar rounding for other reports so an intensity of 115 knots is rated category 4, but the conversion to miles per hour 132.3 mph would round down to 130 mph making it appear to be a category 3 storm likewise an intensity of 135 knots 155 mph and thus category 4 is 250.02 km h which according to the definition used before the change would be category 5. to resolve these issues the nhc had been obliged to incorrectly report storms with wind speeds of 115 kn as 135 mph and 135 kn as 245 km h the change in definition allows storms of 115 kn to be correctly rounded down to 130 mph and storms of 135 kn to be correctly reported as 250 km h and still qualify as category 4. since the nhc had previously rounded incorrectly to keep storms in category 4 in each unit of measure the change does not affect the classification of storms from previous years 5 the new scale became operational on may 15, 2012. 9 categories edit the scale separates hurricanes into five different categories based on wind the u.s national hurricane center classifies hurricanes of category 3 and above as major hurricanes and the joint typhoon warning center classifies typhoons of 150 mph or greater strong category 4 and category 5 as super typhoons although all tropical cyclones can be very dangerous  most weather agencies use the definition for sustained winds recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo  which specifies measuring winds at a height of 33 ft 10.1 m for 10 minutes and then taking the average by contrast the u.s national weather service central pacific hurricane center and the joint typhoon warning center define sustained winds as average winds over a period of one minute measured at the same 33 ft 10.1 m height 10 11 and that is the definition used for this scale intensity of example hurricanes is from both the time of landfall and the maximum intensity the scale is roughly logarithmic in wind speed and the top wind speed for category c c 1 to 4, as there is no upper limit for category 5 can be expressed as 83x10 c 15 miles per hour rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 – except that after the change mentioned above category 4 is now widened by 1 mph in each direction the five categories are in order of increasing intensity 12 category 1 edit category 1 sustained winds

significant structural damage to most well-constructed permanent structures however they can topple unanchored mobile homes as well as uproot or snap weak trees poorly attached roof shingles or tiles can blow off coastal flooding and pier damage are often associated with category 1 storms power outages are typically widespread to extensive sometimes lasting several days even though it is the least intense type of hurricane the storm can still produce widespread damage and can be a life-threatening storm 5 hurricanes that peaked at category 1 intensity and made landfall at that intensity include

piers can receive considerable damage and many trees are uprooted or snapped mobile homes whether anchored or not are typically damaged and sometimes destroyed and many manufactured homes also suffer structural damage small craft in unprotected anchorages may break their moorings extensive to near-total power outages and scattered loss of potable water are likely possibly lasting many days 5

storms can cause some structural damage to small residences and utility buildings particularly those of wood frame or manufactured materials with minor curtain wall failures buildings that lack a solid foundation such as mobile homes are usually destroyed and gable-end roofs are peeled off manufactured homes usually sustain severe and irreparable damage flooding near the coast destroys smaller structures while larger structures are struck by floating debris a large number of trees are uprooted or snapped isolating many areas additionally terrain may be flooded well inland near-total to total power loss is likely for up to several weeks and water will likely also be lost or contaminated 5 hurricanes that peaked at category 3 intensity and made landfall at that intensity include easy

is the highest category of the saffir–simpson scale these storms cause complete roof failure on many residences and industrial buildings and some complete building failures with small utility buildings blown over or away collapse of many wide-span roofs and walls especially those with no interior supports is common very heavy and irreparable damage to many wood frame structures and total destruction to mobile manufactured homes is prevalent only a few types of structures are capable of surviving intact and only if located at least 3 to 5 miles 5 to 8 km inland they include office condominium and apartment buildings and hotels that are of solid concrete or steel frame construction public multi-story concrete parking garages and residences that are made of either reinforced brick or concrete cement block and have hipped roofs with slopes of no less than 35 degrees from horizontal and no overhangs of any kind and if the windows are either made of hurricane-resistant safety glass or covered with shutters unless all of these requirements are met the absolute destruction of a structure is certain 5 the storm s flooding causes major damage to the lower floors of all structures near the shoreline and many coastal structures can be completely flattened or washed away by the storm surge virtually all trees are uprooted or snapped and some may be debarked isolating most affected communities massive evacuation of residential areas may be required if the hurricane threatens populated areas total and extremely long-lived power outages and water losses are to be expected possibly for up to several months 5 historical examples of storms that made landfall at category 5 status include cuba 1924  okeechobee 1928  bahamas 1932  cuba–brownsville 1933  labor day

landfall at that strength in the eastern pacific basin criticism edit some scientists including kerry emanuel and lakshmi kantha have criticized the scale as being simplistic indicating that the scale takes into account neither the physical size of a storm nor the amount of precipitation it produces 7 additionally they and others point out that the saffir–simpson scale unlike the richter scale used to measure earthquakes is not continuous and is quantized into a small number of categories proposed replacement classifications include the hurricane intensity index which is based on the dynamic pressure caused by a storm s winds and the hurricane hazard index which is based on surface wind speeds the radius of maximum winds of the storm and its translational velocity 15 16 both of these scales are continuous akin to the richter scale 17 however neither of these scales have been used by officials category 6 edit after the series of powerful storm systems of the 2005 atlantic hurricane season a few newspaper columnists and scientists brought up the suggestion of introducing category 6, and they have suggested pegging category 6 to storms with winds greater than 174 or 180 mph 78 or 80 m s 151 or 156 kn 280 or 290 km h  7 18 only a few storms of this intensity have been recorded of the 33 hurricanes currently considered to have attained category 5 status in the atlantic 17 had wind speeds at 175 mph 78 m s 152 kn 282 km h or greater and only seven had wind speeds at 180 mph 80 m s 160 kn 290 km h or greater the 1935 labor day hurricane allen gilbert mitch rita wilma and irma  of the 15 hurricanes currently considered to have attained category 5 status in the eastern pacific only six had wind speeds at 175 mph 78 m s 152 kn 282 km h or greater patsy john linda rick and patricia  and only three had wind speeds at 180 mph 80 m s 160 kn 290 km h or greater linda rick and patricia  however most storms which would be eligible for this category were typhoons in the western pacific most notably typhoon tip in 1979 with sustained winds of 190 mph 310 km h and typhoons haiyan and meranti in 2013 and 2016, respectively with sustained winds of 195 mph 314 km h  19 according to robert simpson there are no reasons for a category 6 on the saffir–simpson scale because it is designed to measure the potential damage of a hurricane to human-made structures simpson stated that ..when you get up into winds in excess of 155 mph 249 km h you have enough damage if that extreme wind sustains itself for as much as six seconds on a building it s going to cause rupturing damages that are serious no matter how well it s engineered 3 despite his statements the counties of broward and miami-dade in florida have building codes which require critical infrastructure buildings to be able to withstand category 5 winds 20 which contradicts mr simpson s assessment of building strength
