satellite ers 2 in context of spaceflight a satellite is an artificial object which has been intentionally placed into orbit such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as earth s moon in 1957 the soviet union launched the world s first artificial satellite sputnik 1. since then about 6,600 satellites from more than 40 countries have been launched according to a 2013 estimate 3,600 remained in orbit 1 of those about 1,000 were operational 2 while the rest have lived out their useful lives and became space debris approximately 500 operational satellites are in low-earth orbit 50 are in medium-earth orbit at 20,000 km  and the rest are in geostationary orbit at 36,000 km  3 a few large satellites have been launched in parts and assembled in orbit over a dozen space probes have been placed into orbit around other bodies and become artificial satellites to the moon mercury venus mars jupiter saturn a few asteroids 4 and the sun satellites are used for many purposes common types include military and civilian earth observation satellites communications satellites navigation satellites weather satellites and space telescopes space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites satellite orbits vary greatly depending on the purpose of the satellite and are classified in a number of ways well-known overlapping classes include low earth orbit polar orbit and geostationary orbit a launch vehicle is a rocket that throws a satellite into orbit usually it lifts off from a launch pad on land some are launched at sea from a submarine or a mobile maritime platform or aboard a plane see air launch to orbit  satellites are usually semi-independent computer-controlled systems satellite subsystems attend many tasks such as power generation thermal control telemetry attitude control and orbit control history edit early conceptions edit newton s cannonball  presented as a thought experiment in a treatise of the system of the world by isaac newton was the first published mathematical study of the possibility of an artificial satellite the first fictional depiction of a satellite being launched into orbit was a short story by edward everett hale the brick moon 5 6 the idea surfaced again in jules verne s the begum s fortune 1879  konstantin tsiolkovsky in 1903, konstantin tsiolkovsky 1857–1935 published exploring space using jet propulsion devices in russian исследование мировых пространств реактивными приборами  which is the first academic treatise on the use of rocketry to launch spacecraft he calculated the orbital speed required for a minimal orbit and that a multi-stage rocket fuelled by liquid propellants could achieve this in 1928, herman potočnik 1892–1929 published his sole book the problem of space travel — the rocket motor german das problem der befahrung des weltraums — der raketen-motor  he described the use of orbiting spacecraft for observation of the ground and described how the special conditions of space could be useful for scientific experiments animation depicting the orbits of gps satellites in medium earth orbit in a 1945 wireless world article the english science fiction writer arthur c clarke 1917–2008 described in detail the possible use of communications satellites for mass communications 7 he suggested that three geostationary satellites would provide coverage over the entire planet the us military studied the idea of what was referred to as the earth satellite vehicle when secretary of defense james forrestal made a public announcement on 29 december 1948, that his office was coordinating that project between the various services 8 artificial satellites edit sputnik 1 the first artificial satellite to orbit earth the first artificial satellite was sputnik 1, launched by the soviet union on 4 october 1957, and initiating the soviet sputnik program with sergei korolev as chief designer this in turn triggered the space race between the soviet union and the united states sputnik 1 helped to identify the density of high atmospheric layers through measurement of its orbital change and provided data on radio-signal distribution in the ionosphere the unanticipated announcement of sputnik 1 s success precipitated the sputnik crisis in the united states and ignited the so-called space race within the cold war sputnik 2 was launched on 3 november 1957 and carried the first living passenger into orbit a dog named laika 9 in may 1946, project rand had released the preliminary design of an experimental world-circling spaceship which stated a satellite vehicle with appropriate instrumentation can be expected to be one of the most potent scientific tools of the twentieth century 10 the united states had been considering launching orbital satellites since 1945 under the bureau of aeronautics of the united states navy the united states air force s project rand eventually released the report but considered the satellite to be a tool for science politics and propaganda rather than a potential military weapon in 1954, the secretary of defense stated i know of no american satellite program 11 in february 1954 project rand released scientific uses for a satellite vehicle written by r.r carhart 12 this expanded on potential scientific uses for satellite vehicles and was followed in june 1955 with the scientific use of an artificial satellite by h.k kallmann and w.w kellogg 13 in the context of activities planned for the international geophysical year 1957–58  the white house announced on 29 july 1955 that the u.s intended to launch satellites by the spring of 1958. this became known as project vanguard on 31 july the soviets announced that they intended to launch a satellite by the fall of 1957. following pressure by the american rocket society the national science foundation and the international geophysical year military interest picked up and in early 1955 the army and navy were working on project orbiter two competing programs the army s which involved using a jupiter c rocket and the civilian navy vanguard rocket to launch a satellite at first they failed initial preference was given to the vanguard program whose first attempt at orbiting a satellite resulted in the explosion of the launch vehicle on national television but finally three months after sputnik 2, the project succeeded explorer 1 became the united states first artificial satellite on 31 january 1958. 14 in june 1961, three-and-a-half years after the launch of sputnik 1, the air force used resources of the united states space surveillance network to catalog 115 earth-orbiting satellites 15 early satellites were constructed as one-off designs with growth in geosynchronous geo satellite communication multiple satellites began to be built on single model platforms called satellite buses the first standardized satellite bus design was the hs-333 geo commsat launched in 1972. the largest artificial satellite currently orbiting the earth is the international space station 1u cubesat estcube-1 developed mainly by the students from the university of tartu carries out a tether deployment experiment in low earth orbit space surveillance network edit main article united states space surveillance network the united states space surveillance network ssn  a division of the united states strategic command has been tracking objects in earth s orbit since 1957 when the soviet union opened the space age with the launch of sputnik i since then the ssn has tracked more than 26,000 objects the ssn currently tracks more than 8,000 man-made orbiting objects the rest have re-entered earth s atmosphere and disintegrated or survived re-entry and impacted the earth the ssn tracks objects that are 10 centimeters in diameter or larger those now orbiting earth range from satellites weighing several tons to pieces of spent rocket bodies weighing only 10 pounds about seven percent are operational satellites i.e 560 satellites  the rest are space debris 16 the united states strategic command is primarily interested in the active satellites but also tracks space debris which upon reentry might otherwise be mistaken for incoming missiles non-military satellite services edit there are three basic categories of non-military satellite services 17 fixed satellite services edit fixed satellite services handle hundreds of billions of voice data and video transmission tasks across all countries and continents between certain points on the earth s surface mobile satellite systems edit mobile satellite systems help connect remote regions vehicles ships people and aircraft to other parts of the world and or other mobile or stationary communications units in addition to serving as navigation systems scientific research satellites commercial and noncommercial edit scientific research satellites provide meteorological information land survey data e.g remote sensing  amateur ham radio and other different scientific research applications such as earth science marine science and atmospheric research types edit astronomical satellites are satellites used for observation of distant planets galaxies and other outer space objects biosatellites are satellites designed to carry living organisms generally for scientific experimentation communications satellites are satellites stationed in space for the purpose of telecommunications modern communications satellites typically use geosynchronous orbits molniya orbits or low earth orbits earth observation satellites are satellites intended for non-military uses such as environmental monitoring meteorology map making etc see especially earth observing system navigational satellites are satellites which use radio time signals transmitted to enable mobile receivers on the ground to determine their exact location the relatively clear line of sight between the satellites and receivers on the ground combined with ever-improving electronics allows satellite navigation systems to measure location to accuracies on the order of a few meters in real time killer satellites are satellites that are designed to destroy enemy warheads satellites and other space assets crewed spacecraft spaceships are large satellites able to put humans into and beyond an orbit and return them to earth spacecraft including spaceplanes of reusable systems have major propulsion or landing facilities they can be used as transport to and from the orbital stations miniaturized satellites are satellites of unusually low masses and small sizes 18 new classifications are used to categorize these satellites minisatellite 500–100 kg  microsatellite below 100 kg  nanosatellite below 10 kg  citation needed reconnaissance satellites are earth observation satellite or communications satellite deployed for military or intelligence applications very little is known about the full power of these satellites as governments who operate them usually keep information pertaining to their reconnaissance satellites classified recovery satellites are satellites that provide a recovery of reconnaissance biological space-production and other payloads from orbit to earth international space station space stations are artificial orbital structures that are designed for human beings to live on in outer space a space station is distinguished from other crewed spacecraft by its lack of major propulsion or landing facilities space stations are designed for medium-term living in orbit for periods of weeks months or even years tether satellites are satellites which are connected to another satellite by a thin cable called a tether weather satellites are primarily used to monitor earth s weather and climate 19 orbit types edit main article list of orbits various earth orbits to scale cyan represents low earth orbit yellow represents medium earth orbit the black dashed line represents geosynchronous orbit the green dash-dot line the orbit of global positioning system gps satellites and the red dotted line the orbit of the international space station iss  the first satellite sputnik 1, was put into orbit around earth and was therefore in geocentric orbit by far this is the most common type of orbit with approximately 1,459 20 artificial satellites orbiting the earth geocentric orbits may be further classified by their altitude inclination and eccentricity the commonly used altitude classifications of geocentric orbit are low earth orbit leo  medium earth orbit meo and high earth orbit heo  low earth orbit is any orbit below 2,000 km medium earth orbit is any orbit between 2,000 and 35,786 km high earth orbit is any orbit higher than 35,786 km centric classifications edit geocentric orbit an orbit around the planet earth such as the moon or artificial satellites currently there are approximately 1,459 20 artificial satellites orbiting the earth heliocentric orbit an orbit around the sun in our solar system all planets comets and asteroids are in such orbits as are many artificial satellites and pieces of space debris moons by contrast are not in a heliocentric orbit but rather orbit their parent planet areocentric orbit an orbit around the planet mars such as by moons or artificial satellites the general structure of a satellite is that it is connected to the earth stations that are present on the ground and connected through terrestrial links altitude classifications edit low earth orbit leo geocentric orbits ranging in altitude from 180 km - 2,000 km 1,200 mi medium earth orbit meo geocentric orbits ranging in altitude from 2,000 km 1,200 mi - 35,786 km 22,236 mi  also known as an intermediate circular orbit geosynchronous orbit geo geocentric circular orbit with an altitude of 35,786 kilometres 22,236 mi  the period of the orbit equals one sidereal day coinciding with the rotation period of the earth the speed is approximately 3,000 metres per second 9,800 ft s  high earth orbit heo geocentric orbits above the altitude of geosynchronous orbit 35,786 km 22,236 mi  orbital altitudes of several significant satellites of earth inclination classifications edit inclined orbit an orbit whose inclination in reference to the equatorial plane is not zero degrees polar orbit an orbit that passes above or nearly above both poles of the planet on each revolution therefore it has an inclination of or very close to 90 degrees polar sun synchronous orbit a nearly polar orbit that passes the equator at the same local time on every pass useful for image taking satellites because shadows will be nearly the same on every pass eccentricity classifications edit circular orbit an orbit that has an eccentricity of 0 and whose path traces a circle hohmann transfer orbit an orbit that moves a spacecraft from one approximately circular orbit usually the orbit of a planet to another using two engine impulses the perihelion of the transfer orbit is at the same distance from the sun as the radius of one planet s orbit and the aphelion is at the other the two rocket burns change the spacecraft s path from one circular orbit to the transfer orbit and later to the other circular orbit this maneuver was named after walter hohmann elliptic orbit an orbit with an eccentricity greater than 0 and less than 1 whose orbit traces the path of an ellipse geosynchronous transfer orbit an elliptic orbit where the perigee is at the altitude of a low earth orbit leo and the apogee at the altitude of a geosynchronous orbit geostationary transfer orbit an elliptic orbit where the perigee is at the altitude of a low earth orbit leo and the apogee at the altitude of a geostationary orbit molniya orbit a highly elliptic orbit with inclination of 63.4° and orbital period of half of a sidereal day roughly 12 hours  such a satellite spends most of its time over two designated areas of the planet specifically russia and the united states  tundra orbit a highly elliptic orbit with inclination of 63.4° and orbital period of one sidereal day roughly 24 hours  such a satellite spends most of its time over a single designated area of the planet synchronous classifications edit synchronous orbit an orbit where the satellite has an orbital period equal to the average rotational period earth s is 23 hours 56 minutes 4.091 seconds of the body being orbited and in the same direction of rotation as that body to a ground observer such a satellite would trace an analemma figure 8 in the sky semi-synchronous orbit sso an orbit with an altitude of approximately 20,200 km 12,600 mi and an orbital period equal to one-half of the average rotational period earth s is approximately 12 hours of the body being orbited geosynchronous orbit gso orbits with an altitude of approximately 35,786 km 22,236 mi  such a satellite would trace an analemma figure 8 in the sky geostationary orbit geo a geosynchronous orbit with an inclination of zero to an observer on the ground this satellite would appear as a fixed point in the sky 21 clarke orbit another name for a geostationary orbit named after scientist and writer arthur c clarke supersynchronous orbit a disposal storage orbit above gso geo satellites will drift west also a synonym for disposal orbit subsynchronous orbit a drift orbit close to but below gso geo satellites will drift east graveyard orbit an orbit a few hundred kilometers above geosynchronous that satellites are moved into at the end of their operation disposal orbit a synonym for graveyard orbit junk orbit a synonym for graveyard orbit areosynchronous orbit a synchronous orbit around the planet mars with an orbital period equal in length to mars sidereal day 24.6229 hours areostationary orbit aso a circular areosynchronous orbit on the equatorial plane and about 17000 km 10557 miles above the surface to an observer on the ground this satellite would appear as a fixed point in the sky heliosynchronous orbit a heliocentric orbit about the sun where the satellite s orbital period matches the sun s period of rotation these orbits occur at a radius of 24,360 gm 0.1628 au around the sun a little less than half of the orbital radius of mercury special classifications edit sun-synchronous orbit an orbit which combines altitude and inclination in such a way that the satellite passes over any given point of the planets surface at the same local solar time such an orbit can place a satellite in constant sunlight and is useful for imaging spy and weather satellites moon orbit the orbital characteristics of earth s moon average altitude of 384,403 kilometers 238,857 mi  elliptical–inclined orbit pseudo-orbit classifications edit horseshoe orbit an orbit that appears to a ground observer to be orbiting a certain planet but is actually in co-orbit with the planet see asteroids 3753 cruithne and 2002 aa29 exo-orbit a maneuver where a spacecraft approaches the height of orbit but lacks the velocity to sustain it suborbital spaceflight a synonym for exo-orbit lunar transfer orbit lto prograde orbit an orbit with an inclination of less than 90° or rather an orbit that is in the same direction as the rotation of the primary retrograde orbit an orbit with an inclination of more than 90° or rather an orbit counter to the direction of rotation of the planet apart from those in sun-synchronous orbit few satellites are launched into retrograde orbit because the quantity of fuel required to launch them is much greater than for a prograde orbit this is because when the rocket starts out on the ground it already has an eastward component of velocity equal to the rotational velocity of the planet at its launch latitude halo orbit and lissajous orbit orbits around lagrangian points satellite subsystems edit the satellite s functional versatility is imbedded within its technical components and its operations characteristics looking at the anatomy of a typical satellite one discovers two modules 17 note that some novel architectural concepts such as fractionated spacecraft somewhat upset this taxonomy spacecraft bus or service module edit the bus module consists of the following subsystems structural subsystem edit the structural subsystem provides the mechanical base structure with adequate stiffness to withstand stress and vibrations experienced during launch maintain structural integrity and stability while on station in orbit and shields the satellite from extreme temperature changes and micro-meteorite damage telemetry subsystem edit the telemetry subsystem aka command and data handling c dh monitors the on-board equipment operations transmits equipment operation data to the earth control station and receives the earth control station s commands to perform equipment operation adjustments power subsystem edit the power subsystem consists of solar panels to convert solar energy into electrical power regulation and distribution functions and batteries that store power and supply the satellite when it passes into the earth s shadow nuclear power sources radioisotope thermoelectric generator have also been used in several successful satellite programs including the nimbus program 1964–1978  22 thermal control subsystem edit main article spacecraft thermal control the thermal control subsystem helps protect electronic equipment from extreme temperatures due to intense sunlight or the lack of sun exposure on different sides of the satellite s body e.g optical solar reflector attitude and orbit control subsystem edit main articles attitude control and spacecraft propulsion the attitude and orbit control subsystem consists of sensors to measure vehicle orientation control laws embedded in the flight software and actuators reaction wheels thrusters  these apply the torques and forces needed to re-orient the vehicle to a desired attitude keep the satellite in the correct orbital position and keep antennas pointed in the right directions communication payload edit the second major module is the communication payload which is made up of transponders a transponder is capable of receiving uplinked radio signals from earth satellite transmission stations antennas  amplifying received radio signals sorting the input signals and directing the output signals through input output signal multiplexers to the proper downlink antennas for retransmission to earth satellite receiving stations antennas  end of life edit when satellites reach the end of their mission this normally occurs within 3 or 4 years after launch  satellite operators have the option of de-orbiting the satellite leaving the satellite in its current orbit or moving the satellite to a graveyard orbit historically due to budgetary constraints at the beginning of satellite missions satellites were rarely designed to be de-orbited one example of this practice is the satellite vanguard 1. launched in 1958, vanguard 1, the 4th manmade satellite put in geocentric orbit was still in orbit as of august 2009. 23 instead of being de-orbited most satellites are either left in their current orbit or moved to a graveyard orbit 24 as of 2002, the fcc requires all geostationary satellites to commit to moving to a graveyard orbit at the end of their operational life prior to launch 25 in cases of uncontrolled de-orbiting the major variable is the solar flux and the minor variables the components and form factors of the satellite itself and the gravitational perturbations generated by the sun and the moon as well as those exercised by large mountain ranges whether above or below sea level  the nominal breakup altitude due to aerodynamic forces and temperatures is 78 km with a range between 72 and 84 km solar panels however are destroyed before any other component at altitudes between 90 and 95 km 26 launch-capable countries edit main article timeline of first orbital launches by nationality this list includes countries with an independent capability to place satellites in orbit including production of the necessary launch vehicle note many more countries have the capability to design and build satellites but are unable to launch them instead relying on foreign launch services this list does not consider those numerous countries but only lists those capable of launching satellites indigenously and the

national satellite using a foreign launcher in 1985, tried to launch a satellite using its own vls 1 launcher three times in 1997, 1999, and 2003, but all attempts were unsuccessful north korea claimed a launch of kwangmyŏngsŏng-1 and kwangmyŏngsŏng-2 satellites in 1998 and 2009, but u.s. russian and other officials and weapons experts later reported that the rockets failed to send a satellite into orbit if that was the goal the united states japan and south korea believe this was actually a ballistic missile test which was a claim also made after north korea s 1998 satellite launch and later rejected by whom the first april 2012 launch of kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 was unsuccessful a fact publicly recognized by the dprk however the december 2012 launch of the second version of kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 was successful putting the dprk s first confirmed satellite into orbit south korea korea aerospace research institute  after launching their first national satellite by foreign

adding to it january 2015 attacks on satellites edit for more details on this topic see anti-satellite weapon in recent times timeframe  satellites have been hacked by militant organizations to broadcast propaganda and to pilfer classified information from military communication networks 103 104 for testing purposes satellites in low earth orbit have been destroyed by ballistic missiles launched from earth russia the united states and china have demonstrated the ability to eliminate satellites 105 in 2007 the chinese military shot down an aging weather satellite 105 followed by the us navy shooting down a defunct spy satellite in february 2008. 106 jamming edit see also radio jamming due to the low received signal strength of satellite transmissions they are prone to jamming by land-based transmitters such jamming is limited to the geographical area within the transmitter s range gps satellites are potential targets for jamming 107 108 but satellite phone and television signals have also been subjected to jamming 109 110 also it is very easy to transmit a carrier radio signal to a geostationary satellite and thus interfere with the legitimate uses of the satellite s transponder it is common for earth stations to transmit at the wrong time or on the wrong frequency in commercial satellite space and dual-illuminate the transponder rendering the frequency unusable satellite operators now have sophisticated monitoring that enables them to pinpoint the source of any carrier and manage the transponder space effectively citation needed satellite services edit
