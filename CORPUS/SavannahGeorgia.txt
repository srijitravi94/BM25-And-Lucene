confederacy s sixth most populous city and the prime objective of general william t sherman s march to the sea early on december 21, 1864, local authorities negotiated a peaceful surrender to save savannah from destruction and union troops marched into the city at dawn 10 savannah was named for the savannah river which probably derives from variant names for the shawnee a native american people who migrated to the river in the 1680s the shawnee destroyed another native people the westo and occupied their lands at the head of the savannah river s navigation on the fall line near present-day augusta 11 these shawnee whose native name was ša·wano·ki literally southerners  12 were known by several local variants including shawano savano savana and savannah 13 another theory is that the name savannah refers to the extensive marshlands surrounding the river for miles inland and is derived from the english term savanna  a kind of tropical grassland which was borrowed by the english from spanish sabana and used in the southern colonies the spanish word comes from the taino word zabana 14 still other theories suggest that the name savannah originates from algonquian terms meaning not only southerners but perhaps salt  15 16 geography edit savannah lies on the savannah river approximately 20 mi 32 km upriver from the atlantic ocean 17 according to the united states census bureau
