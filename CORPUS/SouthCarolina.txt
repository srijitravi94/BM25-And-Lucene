partnered with the federal government to help these people run the cotton farms themselves under the port royal experiment workers were paid by the pound harvested and thus became the first former slaves freed by the union forces to earn wages 23 although the state was not a major battleground the war ruined the economy under conscription all men aged 18–35 later 45 were drafted for confederate

white redeemers and pro-business bourbon democrats in 1877, the federal government withdrew its troops as part of the compromise of 1877 that ended reconstruction populist and agrarian movements edit the state became a hotbed of racial and economic tensions during the populist and agrarian movements of the 1890s a republican-populist biracial coalition took power away from white democrats temporarily to prevent that from happening again democrats gained passage of a new constitution in 1895 that effectively disfranchised almost all blacks and many poor whites by new requirements for poll taxes residency and literacy tests that dramatically reduced the voter rolls by 1896, only 5,500 black voters remained on the voter registration rolls although they constituted a majority of the state s population 26 the 1900 census demonstrated the extent of disenfranchisement the 782,509 african american citizens comprised more than 58 of the state s population but they were essentially without any political representation in the jim crow society 27 the 1895 constitution overturned local representative government reducing the role of the counties to agents of state government effectively ruled by the general assembly through the legislative delegations for each county as each county had one state senator that person had considerable power the counties lacked representative government until home rule was passed in 1975. 28 governor pitchfork ben tillman  a populist led the effort to disenfranchise the blacks and poor whites although he controlled democratic state politics from the 1890s to 1910 with a base among poor white farmers during the constitutional convention in 1895, he supported another man s proposal that the state adopt a one-drop rule as well as prohibit marriage between whites and anyone with any known african ancestry some members of the convention realized that prominent white families with some african ancestry could be affected by such legislation in terms similar to a debate in virginia in 1853 on a similar proposal which was dropped  george dionysius tillman said the following in opposition if the law is made as it now stands respectable families in aiken barnwell colleton and orangeburg will be denied the right to intermarry among people with whom they are now associated and identified at least one hundred families would be affected to my knowledge they have sent good soldiers to the confederate army and are now landowners and taxpayers those men served creditably and it would be unjust and disgraceful to embarrass them in this way it is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded caucasian on the floor of this convention every member has in him a certain mixture of… colored blood the pure-blooded white has needed and received a certain infusion of darker blood to give him readiness and purpose it would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation of scandal horror feud and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote perhaps obsolete trace of negro blood the doors would be open to scandal malice and greed to statements on the witness stand that the father or grandfather or grandmother had said that a or b had negro blood in their veins any man who is half a man would be ready to blow up half the world with dynamite to prevent or avenge attacks upon the honor of his mother in the legitimacy or purity of the blood of his father 29 30 31 32 the state postponed such a one-drop law for years virginian legislators adopted a one-drop law in 1924, forgetting that their state had many people of mixed ancestry among those who identified as white 20th century edit children in port royal south carolina ca 1912. some of the children went to school

coastal plain is referred to as the low country and the other two regions as up country 39 the atlantic coastal plain makes up two-thirds of the state its eastern border is the sea islands a chain of tidal and barrier islands the border between the low country and the up country is defined by the atlantic seaboard fall line which marks the limit of navigable rivers the state s coastline contains many salt marshes and estuaries as well as natural ports such as georgetown and charleston an unusual feature of the coastal plain is a large number of carolina bays the origins of which are uncertain the bays tend to be oval lining up in a northwest to southeast orientation the terrain is flat and the soil is composed entirely of recent sediments such as sand silt and clay areas with better drainage make excellent farmland though some land is swampy the natural areas of the coastal plain are part of the middle atlantic coastal forests ecoregion 40 just west of the coastal plain is the sandhills region the sandhills are remnants of coastal dunes from a time when the land was sunken or the oceans were higher the upstate region contains the roots of an ancient eroded mountain chain it is generally hilly with thin stony clay soils and contains few areas suitable for farming much of the piedmont was once farmed due to the changing economics of farming much of the land is now reforested in loblolly pine for the lumber industry these forests are part of the southeastern mixed forests ecoregion 40 at the southeastern edge of the piedmont is the fall line where rivers drop to the coastal plain the fall line was an important early source of water power mills built to harness this resource encouraged the growth of several cities including the capital columbia the larger rivers are navigable up to the fall line providing a trade route for mill towns the northwestern part of the piedmont is also known as the foothills the cherokee parkway is a scenic driving route through this area this is where table rock state park is located highest in elevation is the blue ridge region containing an escarpment of the blue ridge mountains which continue into north carolina and georgia as part of the southern appalachian mountains sassafras mountain south carolina s highest point at 3,560 feet 1,090 m  is located in this area 41 also located in this area is caesars head

branches also relevant are the state constitution law enforcement agencies federal representation state finances and state taxes south carolina has historically had a weak executive branch and a strong legislature before 1865, governors in south carolina were appointed by the general assembly and held the title president of state the 1865 constitution changed this process requiring a popular election local governments were also weak but the 1867 constitution passed during the reconstruction era extended democratization by establishing home rule for counties which were established from the former designated districts of the state the 1895 state constitution overturned this reducing the role of counties and strengthening the relative role of the state legislature essentially the counties were agents of the state and ruled by the general assembly through the legislative delegation for each county 28 they are geographically comprehensive all areas of the state are included in counties as each county had one state senator that position was particularly powerful this status continued until 1973, when the state constitution was amended to provide for home rule for the counties during this time the state had changed with increasing urbanization but rural counties retained proportionally more power as the legislature was based in representatives elected from counties rather than population districts 85 the federal court case reynolds v sims 1964  established the one-man one-vote concept for electoral representation at the state level legislators were now supposed to represent more or less equal numbers of people 85 residents of urban areas had been found to be markedly underrepresented in the legislature under the county-based system reapportionment made obvious the need for other changes to county structure leading to the legislature passing the constitutional amendment the home rule act of 1975 implemented the amendment giving more power to the counties with urbanization their governments have become increasingly important in the state 85 several changes to the state constitution have affected the office of the governor and the cabinet in 1926 the
