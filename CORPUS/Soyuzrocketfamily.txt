progress soyuz russian союз meaning union  grau index 11a511 is a family of expendable launch systems developed by okb-1 and manufactured by progress rocket space centre in samara russia the soyuz launch vehicle is the most frequently used launch vehicle in the world 1 after the u.s space shuttle program ended in 2011, soyuz rockets became the only launch vehicle able to transport astronauts to the international space station the soyuz vehicles are used as the launcher for the manned soyuz spacecraft as part of the soyuz program as well as to launch unmanned progress supply spacecraft to the international space station and for commercial launches marketed and operated by starsem and arianespace all soyuz rockets use rp-1 and liquid oxygen lox propellant with the exception of the soyuz-u2 which used syntin a variant of rp-1 with lox in the united states it has the library of congress designation a-2 the soyuz family is a subset of the r-7 family history edit soyuz rocket engines a space workhorse edit main articles soyuz rocket  soyuz-u and soyuz-fg the soyuz launcher was introduced in 1966, deriving from the vostok launcher which in turn was based on the 8k74 or r-7a intercontinental ballistic missile it was initially a three-stage rocket with a block i upper stage later a molniya variant was produced by adding a fourth stage allowing it to reach the highly elliptical molniya orbit a later variant was the soyuz-u 2 the production of soyuz launchers reached a peak of 60 per year in the early 1980s it has become the world s most used space launcher flying over 1700 times far more than any other rocket despite its age and perhaps thanks to its simplicity this rocket family has been notable for its low cost and very high reliability both of which appeal to commercial clients soyuz fregat edit main article fregat in the early 1990s plans were made for a redesigned soyuz with a fregat upper stage the fregat engine was developed by npo lavochkin from the propulsion module of its phobos interplanetary probes although endorsed by the russian space agency and the russian ministry of defence in 1993 and designated rus as a russification and modernisation of soyuz and later renamed soyuz-2 a funding shortage prevented implementation of the plan the creation of starsem in july 1996 provided new funding for the creation of a less ambitious variant the soyuz-fregat or soyuz u fregat this consisted of a slightly modified soyuz u combined with the fregat upper stage with a capacity of up to 1,350 kg to geostationary transfer orbit in april 1997, starsem obtained a contract from the european space agency to launch two pairs of cluster 2 plasma science satellites using the soyuz-fregat before the introduction of this new model starsem launched 24 satellites of the globalstar constellation in 6 launches with a restartable ikar upper stage between september 22, 1999 and november 22, 1999. after successful test flights of soyuz-fregat on february 9, 2000 and march 20, 2000, the cluster 2 satellites were launched on july 16, 2000 and august 9, 2000. another soyuz-fregat launched the esa s mars express probe from baikonur in june 2003. now the soyuz-fregat launcher is used by starsem for commercial payloads soyuz-fg erected at the baikonur cosmodrome launch pad 1 5 gagarin s start october 2008 iss crew transport edit between february 1, 2003 and july 26, 2005 with the grounding of the u.s space shuttle fleet soyuz was the only means of transportation to and from the international space station this included the transfer of supplies via progress spacecraft and crew changeovers since the retirement of the space shuttle fleet in 2011, the u.s space program is without any means to take astronauts into orbit and nasa is dependent on the soyuz to send crew into space for the immediate future 3 nasa is scheduled to resume manned flights from the united states in late 2018 or 2019 through the commercial crew development program recent incidents edit a long string of successful soyuz launches was broken on october 15, 2002 when the unmanned soyuz u launch of the photon-m satellite from plesetsk fell back near the launch pad and exploded 29 seconds after lift-off one person from the ground crew was killed and eight injured another failure occurred on june 21, 2005, during a molniya military communications satellite launch from the plesetsk launch site which used a four-stage version of the rocket called molniya-m the flight ended six minutes after the launch because of a failure of the third stage engine or an unfulfilled order to separate the second and third stages the rocket s second and third stages which are identical to the soyuz and its payload a molniya-3k satellite crashed in the uvatski region of tyumen siberia  4 on august 24, 2011, an unmanned soyuz-u carrying cargo to the international space station crashed failing to reach orbit on december 23, 2011 a soyuz-2.1b launching a meridian-5 military communications satellite failed in the 7th minute of launch because of an anomaly in the third stage 5 soyuz-2 and guiana spaceport edit soyuz 2 ready to launch 2007 main articles soyuz-2 and soyuz at the guiana space centre the venerable soyuz launcher is gradually being replaced by a new version now named soyuz st or soyuz-2  which has a new digital guidance system and a highly modified third stage with a new engine the first development version of soyuz 2 called soyuz-2-1a which is already equipped with the digital guidance system but is still propelled by an old third stage engine started on november 4, 2004 from plesetsk on a suborbital test flight followed by an orbital flight on october 23, 2006 from baikonur the fully modified launcher version soyuz-2-1b flew first on december 27, 2006 with the corot satellite from the baikonur cosmodrome on 19 january 2005, the european space agency and the russian federal space agency agreed to launch soyuz st rockets from the guiana space centre 6 the equatorial launch site allows the soyuz to deliver 2.7 to 4.9 tonnes into sun-synchronous orbit depending on the third-stage engine used 7 construction of a new pad started in 2005 and was completed in april 2011. the pad used vertical loading common at guiana unlike the horizontal loading used at the baikonur cosmodrome 8 a simulated launch was conducted in early may 2011. 9 the first operational launch happened on 21 october 2011, bearing the first two satellites in galileo global positioning system the soyuz-u and soyuz-fg rockets which are still in service are gradually being replaced by soyuz-2 from 2014 onwards and should be retired in 2016. variants edit see also r-7 rocket family soyuz 11a511 1966-1975 soyuz-l

derived from the soyuz family assembling the rocket edit soyuz rocket assembly the first and second stages are in the background already joined together the third stage is in the lower left corner of the image the soyuz spacecraft covered by its launch shroud is in the lower right corner the rocket is assembled horizontally in the assembly and testing building the assembled rocket is transported to the launch site in its horizontal state and then raised this is different from the vertical assembly of for example the saturn v and is one of the features that makes soyuz cheaper citation needed to prepare for launch assembling a horizontally positioned rocket is relatively simple as all modules are easily accessible also assembling the rocket in vertical position would require a windproof highrise hangar which was not considered economically feasible at the time the rocket was designed launch pad edit soyuz tma-13 being erected at the gagarin s start launch pad october 10, 2008. the entire rocket is suspended in the launch system by the load-bearing mechanisms on the strap-on boosters where they are attached to the central core the latter rests on the nose sections of the strap-on boosters this scheme resembles flight conditions when the strap-on boosters push the central core forward the concept of suspending the rocket was one of the novelties introduced with the r-7 soyuz since the launch pad has been eliminated the bottom portion of the missile is lowered the launch system trusses bear the wind loads resistance to high wind is an important feature of the launch system as the kazakhstan steppes where the baikonur launch site is located are known for windstorms launch edit a soyuz-u on the launch pad ahead of the soyuz 19 astp launch on 15 july 1975 during launch the support booms track the movement of the rocket after the support boom heads emerge from the special support recess in the nose sections of the strapons the support booms and trusses disconnect from the rocket airframe swiveling on the support axes and freeing the way for the rocket to lift off during launch the rocket and the launch facility form a single dynamic system when the strapon booster engines stop the boosters fall away providing nonimpact separation if the skies are clear ground observers can see a korolev cross formed by the falling boosters fairings used for unmanned missions edit the soyuz launch vehicle is used for various russian unmanned missions and is also marketed by starsem for commercial satellite launches presently the following fairing types are used progress is the cargo spacecraft for unmanned missions to the iss and previously to mir the spacecraft uses a dedicated platform and fairing and can be launched with either soyuz-u soyuz-fg or soyuz-2 citation needed a-type fairing is used for commercial launches citation needed s-type fairing is used for commercial launches by starsem the fairing has external diameter of 3.7 m and a length of 7.7 m the fregat upper stage is encapsulated in the fairing with the payload and a payload adapter dispenser 10 s-type fairing along with fregat upper stage were used to launch the following spacecraft galaxy 14, giove a mars express amos-2 venus express cluster 11 sl-type fairing is used for commercial launches by starsem the fairing has external diameter of 3.7 m and a length of 8.45 m the fregat upper stage is encapsulated in the fairing with the payload and a payload adapter dispenser 12 sl-type fairing along with fregat upper stage were used to launch the following spacecraft corot citation needed st-type fairing is used for commercial launches by starsem its external diameter is 4.1 m and its length is 11.4 m it can be used with the soyuz-2 only because older analog control system cannot cope with aerodynamic instability introduced by a fairing this large this carbon-plastic fairing is based on the proven configuration used for arianespace’s ariane 4 vehicles with its length increased by approximately one additional meter 13 the fairing has been developed and is being manufactured by tsskb-progress in accordance with the requirements of a customer starsem  this is the only fairing type offered by starsem arianespace for launches from kourou 14 stages edit first stage edit the first stage hauling a crew up to iss 2006 the first stage of soyuz rockets
