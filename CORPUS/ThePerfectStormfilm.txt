ethel shatford bobby s mother christopher mcdonald as todd gross a boston meteorologist working for the wnev-tv the present day whdh-tv  dash mihok as sergeant jeremy mitchell a crewmember on the new york air national guard rescue helicopter historical accuracy edit the andrea gail edit hurricane grace on october 28, 1991, when the andrea gail went missing a ship similar to the andrea gail the lady grace was used during the filming of the movie 3 4 most of the names used were not changed for the fictional film but in response two lawsuits were later filed by certain families of the crew members the film only claims to be based on a true story  and differs in many ways from the book starting with the fictionalization of the material into a story  the events shown in the film after the andrea gail s last radio contact are pure speculation as the boat and the bodies of the crew were never found contrary to the movie s storyline captain linda greenlaw says she did not place a distress call on behalf of the andrea gail without a distress call directly from the imperiled vessel the coast guard will not initiate a search until the vessel is five days overdue in port greenlaw said the 1993 u.s coast guard s investigative report said that the andrea gail was experiencing 30-foot waves and winds from anywhere from 50 to 80 knots 58 - 92 mph around the time of the last communication the conditions though threatening were probably not unfamiliar to tyne who had been a successful fisherman for about a decade on other vessels taking trips to the grand banks and fishing off florida the carolinas and elsewhere 5 in addition hurricane grace 1991 was described by a weather forecaster as a category 5 storm in the movie though it never achieved those wind speeds in the movie tyne and his crew agreed to head into the dangerous storm in order to save their fish from spoiling greenlaw acknowledged that tyne did mention having ice problems but that was not unusual my one gripe about the movie was how warner brothers depicted billy tyne and his crew as making a very conscious decision to steam into a storm that they knew was dangerous said greenlaw that is not what happened the andrea gail was three days into their steam home when the storm hit whatever happened to the andrea gail happened very quickly 5 an air national guard helicopter was dispatched from francis s gabreski air national guard base on long island new york but not in response to the andrea gail or satori mistral in the movie  the helicopter departed mid-storm on a mission to help save a lone japanese fisherman from a sinking sailboat 250 miles off the new jersey coast unsuccessful and running low on fuel the air national guard hh-60g helicopter was compelled to attempt a mid-flight refueling maneuver the zero-visibility conditions thwarted their efforts however and lacking enough fuel to make the flight back to the long island base the crew were forced to ditch the helicopter after a heroic search operation by the tamaroa four of the hh-60 s crew were picked up one was never seen again the japanese yachtsman was later rescued by a romanian cargo ship 5 when asked about the portrayal of sully in the movie cathy sullivan mustone an older sister of david sully sullivan said she was disappointed they made my brother s character out to be a hothead she said i guess every movie needs a villain but my brother was a funny guy with a loud laugh and a big smile he had a lot of guts and he loved fishing in fact david s bravery and quick thinking made headlines on a different boatâ€”the harmony one night during a winter fishing trip the harmony began taking on water while tied to another boat the crew of the harmony yelled for help hoping to wake the nearby crew no one woke so david dove into the icy water pulling himself on the ropes that tied the boats together as a result of his bravery the harmony s crew was saved mustone said at least in the movie they did represent my brother s bravery in a water rescue scene he was a good man and i just know he is at peace in heaven safe with our dad 5 the satori edit the crew members of satori renamed mistral in the movie were not rescued by an air national guard helicopter but rather a u.s coast guard helicopter the helicopter was changed in the film after the air national guard had issues consulting with the movie producers according to the owner s son the satori never made a 360Â° roll although it had two knockdowns during which it lay on its side for about 30 seconds 6 in response to requests by the crew captain ray leonard permitted the two crewmembers to make a position report over radio during which they made an unauthorized mayday call one of those crewmembers reported that she was so convinced that she was going to die that she wrote her name down and put it into a plastic bag so that her body could be identified when it was finally found there is controversy over whether the captain was drunk as charged by the women in the book with leonard objecting to this characterization out of compassion for the expected loss of his boat the coast guard did not test his blood alcohol levels at the time the coast guard declared the voyage manifestly unsafe and ordered everyone off-board including the unwilling skipper 6 the coast guard first tried to take them on board via an inflatable boat but after it was damaged when trying to approach the satori they sent a helicopter which is a much riskier approach as a rescue swimmer must jump into dangerous seas the coast guard helicopter did not try to lower rescue gear onto the yacht as shown in the movie where it gets entangled with the mast  but rather asked the crew of the satori to jump overboard to meet a rescue swimmer in the water leonard eventually complied with the request after the storm leonard searched for the satori  hoping to find her still afloat but in spite of his attempts she was found a few days later washed ashore on a maryland beach a bag of personal belongings still on deck leonard paid for a 60-foot fishing vessel to drag her off the beach helped by a channel dug by park rangers who had been guarding the boat he continued to sail the boat until 2000, and she remained in use with a new owner as of may 2000 update  6 reception edit the perfect storm received mixed reviews from critics with a 47 approval rating on critic site rotten tomatoes with a consensus of while the special effects are well done and quite impressive this film suffers a lack of any actual drama or characterization the end result is a film that offers nifty eye-candy and nothing else 7 the perfect storm was a huge box office success on its opening weekend the film debuted with 42 million ahead of sony s the patriot and eventually brought in over 182.6 million in the united states and 146.1 million around the world to a total of 328.7 million worldwide 8 the film was nominated for two academy awards best visual effects walt conti stefen fangmeier john frazier and habib zargarpour and best sound john t reitz gregg rudloff david e campbell and keith a wester  but lost both to gladiator 9 lawsuits edit after the film was released the families of two crew members sued the film makers for the fictionalization of events which happened prior to the loss of the andrea gail 10 in 2005, the florida supreme court ruled against the family of captain tyne by a 6â€“2 vote some unnamed families also sued the producers in federal district court claiming that their names were used without their permission and that facts were changed 11 the district court which is also located in florida dismissed the case as in their opinion the defendants first amendment right to freedom of speech barred the suit the plaintiffs appealed to the u.s court of appeals for the 11th circuit which could not decide how to interpret the florida law at issue and certified the question to the florida supreme court in the end the florida supreme court upheld the district court s interpretation of florida law and remanded the case to the 11th circuit which affirmed the prior decision to dismiss the case 11
