its name retired without ever having reached hurricane strength meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on may 21, 2001. it moved westward across the atlantic ocean retaining little convection on its way after moving across south america and the southwestern caribbean sea the wave entered the eastern north pacific ocean on june 1. a low-level circulation developed on june 2, while it was about 230 miles 370 km south-southeast of salina cruz mexico southerly flow forced the system northward and the wave moved inland on june 3. the low-level circulation dissipated though the mid-level circulation persisted it emerged into the gulf of mexico on june 4, and developed deep convection on its eastern side 2 early on june 5, satellite imagery suggested that a tropical depression was forming in the northwest gulf of mexico which was furthered by reports of wind gusts as high as 60 mph 95 km h just a few hundred feet above the surface towards the east side of the system 3 at 1200 utc on june 5, the disturbance developed a broad low-level circulation and was classified as tropical storm allison the first storm of the 2001 atlantic hurricane season some intensification was projected though it was expected to be hindered by cool offshore sea surface temperatures 4 due to the cold-core nature of the center allison initially contained subtropical characteristics despite this the storm quickly strengthened to attain peak sustained winds of 60 mph 95 km h  with tropical storm-force winds extending up to 230 miles 370 km east of the center and a minimum central pressure of 1000 mbar 2 the storm initially moved very little and the presence of several small vortices from within the deep convection caused difficulty in determining the exact center location 5 later in the day several different track forecasts arose one scenario had the cyclone tracking westward into mexico another projected the storm moving east towards southern louisiana at the time it was noted that little rain or wind persisted near the center but rather to the north and east 6 under the steering currents of a subtropical ridge that extended in an east–west orientation across the southeast united states 5 allison weakened while nearing the texas coastline and struck near freeport texas with 50 mph 80 km h winds 2 inland the storm rapidly weakened and the national hurricane center discontinued advisories early on june 6. 7 shortly after being downgraded to a tropical depression surface observations showed an elongated circulation with a poorly defined center which had reformed closer to the deep convection 8 subtropical storm allison with an eye-like feature over mississippi the depression drifted northward until reaching lufkin texas where it stalled due to a high pressure system to its north 2 while stalling over texas the storm dropped excessive rainfall peaking at just over 40 inches 1,033 mm in northwestern jefferson county 9 on june 7, the subtropical ridge off florida weakened while the ridge west of texas intensified this steered tropical depression allison to make a clockwise loop and the storm began drifting to the southwest as the center reached huntsville texas a heavy rain band began to back build from louisiana westward into liberty county texas which had caused additional flooding 10 at the time the system had a minimum central pressure of about 1004 mb and maximum sustained winds of about 10 mph 16 km h  11 late on june 9 and early on june 10, allison s remnants reentered reached the gulf of mexico and emerged over open waters 12 the low once again became nearly stationary about 60 mi 100 km south of galveston texas and despite more favorable upper-level winds it showed no signs of redevelopment 13 due to dry air and moderate westerly wind shear the storm transformed into a subtropical cyclone while the subtropical depression moved eastward a new low level circulation redeveloped to the east and allison quickly made landfall on morgan city louisiana on june 11. 2 at around the same time the surface center reformed to the east-northeast of its previous location aligning with the mid-level circulation 14 strong thunderstorms redeveloped over the circulation and allison strengthened into a subtropical storm over southeastern louisiana 2 the storm intensified further to attain sustained winds of 45 mph 70 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of about 1000 mb near mclain mississippi accompanied by a well-defined eye-like feature 15 subtropical depression allison over north carolina on june 15 the storm was officially downgraded to a subtropical depression at 0000 utc on june 12. somewhat accelerating the depression tracked to the east-northeast through mississippi alabama georgia and south carolina before becoming nearly stationary near wilmington north carolina 2 the depression drifted through north carolina and sped to the northeast for a time in response to an approaching cold front 16 though satellite and radar imagery show the system was well-organized the system slowed and moved erratically for a period of time 17 executing what appeared to be a small counterclockwise loop 18 the storm began tracking in a generally northeasterly direction and crossed into the southern delmarva peninsula on june 16. 19 the subtropical remnants reached the atlantic on june 17, and while located east of atlantic city new jersey winds began to restrengthen and heavy rains formed to the north of the circulation the low was interacting with a frontal boundary and started merging with it as it accelerated to the northeast at 13 mph 21 km h  20 the remnants of allison briefly reintensified to a subtropical storm through baroclinic processes though it became extratropical while south of long island 2 by later on june 17, the low was situated off the coast of rhode island spreading a swath of precipitation over new england 21 the remnants of the tropical storm were then absorbed by the frontal boundary by june 18, and eventually passed south of cape race newfoundland on june 20, where the extratropical cyclone dissipated 2 preparations edit main article effects of tropical storm allison in texas shortly after the storm formed officials in galveston
