named storm of the 2008 atlantic hurricane season marco developed out of a broad area of low pressure over the northwestern caribbean during late september 2008. influenced by a tropical wave on october 4, a small low-level circulation center developed over belize after crossing the southern end of the yucatán peninsula and emerging into the bay of campeche the low was declared tropical depression thirteen early on october 6. the depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name marco later that day marco reached its peak intensity with winds of 65 mph 100 km h early on october 7. around this time tropical storm force winds extended 11.5 miles 18.5 km from the center of the storm making marco the smallest tropical cyclone on record 1 2 around 1200 utc marco made landfall near misantla veracruz the storm rapidly weakened after landfall dissipating later that day due to its small size marco caused minimal damage however the storm s heavy rains led to

storm marco originated in a broad area of low pressure that persisted over the northwestern caribbean in late september 2008. on october 4, a tropical wave reached the same area and the system spawned a circulation center over belize development of the low was initially inhibited by its proximity to land as the system neared the bay of campeche convection quickly developed around the low at 0000

west-northwest direction forecasters anticipated intensification up until landfall because of the storm s well-developed outflow and the low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures in its path 3 by 1200 utc the small cyclone with a cloud shield no more than 85 miles 137 kilometers across was upgraded to tropical storm marco 2 favorable conditions for development allowed marco to quickly intensify throughout the day on october 6. early on october 7, marco reached its peak intensity with winds of 65 mph 105 km h and a minimum pressure of 998 millibar hpa 29.47 inhg  2 this was based on a reconnaissance mission into marco which recorded flight-level winds of 70 mph 110 km h  corresponding to a surface wind speed of 61 mph 98 km h  following the quick increase in intensity forecasters noted the possibility of marco intensifying into a hurricane before making landfall 4 the storm maintained a small area of deep convection averaging 9.2 miles 14.8 km in diameter as it continued moving towards the west-northwest 5 shortly after reaching peak intensity tropical storm force winds extended 11.5 miles 18.5 km from the center of marco 6 at 1200 utc the center of marco made landfall near misantla veracruz with winds of 65 mph 105 km h  2 once inland marco rapidly weakened 7 being downgraded to a tropical depression six hours after landfall the small depression dissipated
