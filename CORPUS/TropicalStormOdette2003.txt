odette was a rare off-season tropical storm that affected the caribbean sea in early december 2003. the fifteenth named storm of the 2003 atlantic hurricane season odette formed near the coast of panama a few days after the official end of the atlantic hurricane season and ultimately made landfall on the dominican republic as a moderate tropical storm before becoming extratropical on december 7, dissipating two days later the storm caused heavy damage throughout the dominican republic from unusually heavy rainfall in december preparation preceding odette s landfall resulted in only eight deaths and 14 injuries total damage is unknown though crop damage in the dominican republic totaled to over 8 million 2003 usd 10.4 million 2016 usd  meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale by november 30, the last day of the atlantic hurricane season a stationary front extended across eastern cuba into the southwestern caribbean sea on december 1, a low pressure area developed within the frontal zone just north of panama 1 and an anticyclone aloft produced good outflow over the low-level center 2 the low remained nearly stationary for the next several days and it gradually became separated from the stationary front 1 convection increased across the area due to moisture from the eastern pacific ocean and moderate divergence 3 increased wind shear deteriorated the system on december 2, 4 though convection redeveloped as the system started a northeast drift 5 on december 3 a mid-level circulation developed about 140 miles 225 km north of the surface center convection increased and became better organized as a weak tropical wave reached the area and it is estimated the system developed into tropical depression twenty at around 1200 utc on december 4 while located about 345 miles 560 km south of kingston jamaica 1 initially the depression was forecast to track north-northeastward and pass over western haiti 6 tropical storm odette shortly after being named on december 4 upon being classified as a tropical cyclone the depression was embedded within the southwesterly flow between a ridge over the eastern caribbean sea and a mid-latitude trough which caused a steady east-northeast motion 6 the convection organized into a central dense overcast with a well-defined cloud band wrapping partially around the center and based on satellite imagery estimates the depression was upgraded to tropical storm status late on december 4, the national hurricane center named the storm odette 7 after being named the storm intensified despite moderate southwesterly wind shear and an eye feature became evident on microwave satellite imagery 1 additionally about three–fourths of a mid-level eyewall developed 8 the storm was assessed with winds of 40–50 mph 65–85 km h  though the national hurricane center remarked the winds could have been stronger due to lack of structural data the eye feature diminished as the convective structure deteriorated slightly and hurricane hunters first flew into the storm at around 1200 utc on december 5. 1 odette tracked over an area of warm sea surface temperatures 8 and the overall cloud pattern gradually improved 9 the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory predicted the storm to attain hurricane status 10 early on december 6, a trmm overpass showed an 80 closed eyewall 11 and at 0600 utc odette attained peak winds of 65 mph 100 km h while located about 245 miles 395 km h southwest of santo domingo dominican republic 1 upon reaching peak intensity odette had begun accelerating northeastward which decreased wind shear and slightly increased its southwesterly outflow 11 the low-level center decelerated as it approached hispaniola though the convection continued quickly northeastward failing to maintain vertical organization odette weakened slightly and made landfall on jaragua national park in the pedernales province of the dominican republic around 2300 utc on december 6 with winds of 60 mph 95 km h  the circulation became disrupted as it crossed the country and on december 7 it emerged into the atlantic ocean with winds of 45 mph 75 km h  1 it accelerated to the northeast ahead of an approaching cold front and late on december 7 odette transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as its center became embedded within the front the remnants continued quickly northeastward before losing its identity within the frontal zone on december 9 1 the frontal zone that absorbed odette also absorbed tropical storm peter a few days later 12 preparations edit prior to odette s predicted arrival the dominican republic government issued for the evacuation of more than 10,000 people mostly from those living near rivers at least 2,000 shelters were set up capable of housing up to 800,000 people in addition the government mobilized the army to force those unwilling to leave from their homes such precautions were taken due to already saturated grounds from heavy rainfall three weeks prior 13 a tropical storm watch was issued between santo domingo and the dominican republic haiti border on december 4, 56 hours prior to landfall this was raised to a tropical storm warning on december 5 while 32 hours before landfall in addition tropical storm warnings were issued for all of the haitian coastline and jamaica 1 impact edit while over the southwestern caribbean sea odette dropped heavy rainfall including prior to its formation for several days the storm caused rains in panama costa rica and the east coast of nicaragua in colombia the storm caused rainfall totals of up to 8 inches 200 mm in puerto colombia 13 in jamaica the storm dropped moderate rainfall flooding several roads in saint ann and saint mary parishes 14 odette caused moderate damage and 8 deaths in the dominican republic dominican republic edit flooding in the dominican republic winds from tropical storm odette were relatively light across the dominican republic with a peak gust of 60 mph occurring in santo domingo the storm dropped heavy rainfall for several hours amounting to a maximum of 9.07 inches 230 mm in isla saona several other locations reported over 4 inches as well the rainfall caused mudslides and flash flooding 1 forcing several rivers to overflow in combination with previous rains 15 in addition a tornado was reported near santo domingo destroying one house and uproofing several others 13 the flooding and mudslides damaged up to 60,000 homes and destroyed 34. gusty winds caused power outages river flooding caused two bridges to collapse isolating several communities landslides buried several roads though authorities quickly repaired them the rainfall also flooded fields resulting in severe crop damage 13 as much as 85 of the banana crop was lost while the coffee crop suffered losses shortly before harvest season crop damage totaled to around 8 million 2003 usd  16 in addition excess flooding contaminated water supplies leaving several areas without clean water or sanitation 17 in all tropical storm odette caused 8 deaths and 14 injuries mostly due to flash flooding and mudslides in addition two indirect deaths are associated with the storm due to heart attacks neighboring haiti experienced little from the storm 1 puerto rico and united states virgin islands edit rainfall totals from odette though odette passed 280 miles to the west of mayagüez puerto rico the storm caused moderate rainfall across puerto rico and the united states virgin islands rainfall in puerto rico was heaviest in the southeast where a peak of 8.73 in 221.74 mm was recorded in jajome alto the storm also caused up to 2.2 in 55.9 mm of rainfall in christiansted on saint croix 18 odette s rainfall caused flooding throughout the island s rivers the river flooding destroyed three bridges resulting in 20,000 in damages 2003 usd  the flooding also caused a mudslide near a cemetery in humacao the
