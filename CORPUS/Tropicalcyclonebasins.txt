tropical cyclone basins - wikipedia tropical cyclone basins from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search official tropical cyclone basins traditionally areas of tropical cyclone formation are divided into seven basins these include the north atlantic ocean the eastern and western parts of the northern pacific ocean the southwestern pacific the southwestern and southeastern indian oceans and the northern indian ocean arabian sea and bay of bengal  the western pacific is the most active and the north indian the least active an average of 86 tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide with 47 reaching hurricane typhoon strength and 20 becoming intense tropical cyclones at least of category 3 intensity  1 overview edit tropical cyclone basins

cyclones in the northern atlantic ocean between 1980 and 2005 this region includes the north atlantic ocean the caribbean sea and the gulf of mexico tropical cyclone formation here varies widely from year to year ranging from one to over twenty-five per year 6 most atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes form between june 1 and november 30. the united states national hurricane center nhc monitors the basin and issues reports watches and warnings about tropical weather systems for the atlantic basin as one of the regional specialized meteorological centres for tropical cyclones as defined by the world meteorological organization 7 on average 11 named storms of tropical storm or higher strength occur each season with an average of 6 becoming hurricanes and 2 becoming major hurricanes the climatological peak of activity is around september 10 each season 8 the united states atlantic coast and gulf coast mexico central america the caribbean islands and bermuda are frequently affected by storms in this basin venezuela the 4 provinces of atlantic canada and atlantic macaronesian islands also are occasionally affected many of the more intense atlantic storms are cape verde-type hurricanes which form off the west coast of africa near the cape verde islands occasionally a hurricane that evolves into an extratropical cyclone can reach western europe including hurricane gordon which spread high winds across spain and the british isles in september 2006. 9 hurricane vince which made landfall on the southwestern coast of spain as a tropical depression in october 2005, is the only known system to impact mainland europe as a tropical cyclone in the nhc study period commencing in 1851 10 it is believed a hurricane made landfall in spain in 1842  11 eastern pacific edit main article pacific hurricane tracks of all tropical cyclones in the northern pacific ocean east of the international date line between 1980 and 2005 the vertical line through the center separates the central pacific basin under the central pacific hurricane center s watch from the northeastern pacific basin under the national hurricane center s area of responsibility  the northeastern pacific is the second most active basin and has the highest number of storms per unit area the hurricane season runs between may 15 and november 30 each year and encompasses the vast majority of tropical cyclone activity in the region 12 in the 1971–2005 period there were an average of 15–16 tropical storms 9 hurricanes and 4–5 major hurricanes storms of category 3 intensity or greater annually in the basin 12 storms that form here often affect western mexico and less commonly the continental united states in particular california  or northern central america no hurricane included in the modern database has made landfall in california however historical records from 1858 speak of a storm that brought san diego winds over 75 mph 65 kn 121 km h marginal hurricane force  though it is not known if the storm actually made landfall 13 tropical storms in 1939, 1976 and 1997 brought gale-force winds to california 13 the central pacific hurricane center s area of responsibility aor begins at the boundary with the national hurricane center aor at 140 °w  and ends at the international date line where the northwestern pacific begins 14 the hurricane season in the north central pacific runs annually from june 1 to november 30 15 the central pacific hurricane center monitors the storms that develop or move into the defined area of responsibility 14 the cphc previously tasked with monitoring tropical activity in the basin was originally known as the joint hurricane warning center today it is called the joint typhoon warning center central pacific hurricanes are rare and on average 4 to 5 storms form or move in this area annually 15 as there are no large contiguous landmasses in the basin direct hits and landfalls are rare however they occur occasionally as with hurricane iniki in 1992, which made landfall on hawaii 16 and hurricane ioke in 2006, which made a direct hit on johnston atoll 17 northwestern pacific ocean edit tracks of all tropical cyclones in the northwestern pacific ocean between 1980 and 2005. the vertical line to the right is the international date line main article typhoon the northwest pacific ocean is the most active basin on the planet accounting for one-third of all tropical cyclone activity annually an average of 25.7 tropical cyclones in the basin acquire tropical storm strength or greater also an average of 16 typhoons occurred each year during the 1968–1989 period 6 the basin occupies all the territory north of the equator and west of the international date line including the south china sea 14 the basin sees activity year-round however tropical activity is at its minimum in february and march 18 tropical storms in this region often affect china hong kong japan north korea south korea the philippines taiwan and vietnam plus numerous oceanian islands such as guam the northern marianas and palau sometimes tropical storms in this region affect cambodia laos malaysia thailand and even singapore the coast of china sees the most landfalling tropical cyclones worldwide 19 the philippines archipelago receives an average of 6–7 tropical cyclone landfalls per year 20 north indian ocean edit tracks of all tropical cyclones in the northern indian ocean between 1980 and 2005 this basin is divided into two areas the bay of bengal and the arabian sea with the bay of bengal dominating 5 to 6 times more activity  still this basin is the most inactive worldwide with only 4 to 6 storms per year this basin’s season has a double peak one in april and may before the onset of the monsoon and another in october and november just after 21 this double peak occurs because powerful vertical wind shear in between the surface monsoonal low and upper tropospheric high during the monsoon season tears apart incipient cyclones 22 high shear explains why no cyclones can form in the red sea which possesses the necessary depth vorticity and surface temperatures year-round rarely do tropical cyclones that form elsewhere in this basin affect the arabian peninsula or somalia however cyclone gonu caused heavy damage in oman on the peninsula in 2007. although the north indian ocean is a relatively inactive basin extremely high population densities in the ganges and ayeyarwady deltas mean that the deadliest tropical cyclones in the world have formed here including the 1970 bhola cyclone which killed 500,000 people nations affected include india bangladesh sri lanka thailand myanmar and pakistan mediterranean sea edit main article mediterranean tropical cyclone image of january 1995 system on rare occasions tropical-like systems that can reach the intensity of hurricanes occur over the mediterranean sea such a phenomenon is called a medicane mediterranean-hurricane  although the geographical dimensions of tropical oceans and the mediterranean sea are clearly different the precursor mechanisms of these perturbations based on the air-sea thermodynamic imbalance are similar 23 their origins are typically non-tropical and develop over open waters under strong initially cold-core cyclones similar to subtropical cyclones or anomalous tropical cyclones in the atlantic basin like karl 1980  vince 2005  grace 2009 or chris 2012  24 sea surface temperatures in late-august and early-september are quite high over the basin 24 28 °c or 75 82 °f  though research indicates water temperatures of 20 °c 68 °f are normally required for development 25 meteorological literature document that such systems occurred in september 1947, september 1969, january 1982, september 1983, january 1995, october 1996, september 2006, november 2011 and november 2014. 26 27 the 1995 system developed a well-defined eye and a ship recorded 85 mph 140 km h winds along with an atmospheric pressure of 975 mbar although it had the structure of a tropical cyclone it occurred over 61 °f 16 °c water temperatures suggesting it could have been a polar low 28 southern hemisphere edit within the southern hemisphere tropical cyclones generally form on a regular basis between the african coast and the middle of the south pacific tropical and subtropical cyclones have also been noted occurring in the southern atlantic ocean at times for various reasons including where tropical cyclones form there are several different ways to split the area between the american and african coasts for instance the world meteorological organization define three different basins for the tracking and warning of tropical cyclones these are the south-west indian ocean between the african coast and 90°e the australian region between 90°e and 160°e and the south pacific between 160°e and 120°w the united states joint typhoon warning center also monitors the whole region but splits it at 135°e into the south pacific and the southern indian ocean south-west indian ocean edit tracks of all tropical cyclones in the southwestern indian ocean between 1980 and 2005 the south-west indian ocean is located within the southern hemisphere between the africa s east coast and 90°e and is primarily monitored by the meteo france s la reunion rsmc while the mauritian australian indonesian and malagasy weather services also monitor parts of it 29 until the start of the 1985–86 tropical cyclone season the basin only extended to 80°e with the 10 degrees between 80 and 90e considered to be a part of the australian region 30 on average about 9 cyclones per develop into tropical storms while 5 of those go on to become tropical cyclones that are equivalent to a hurricane or a typhoon 31 the tropical cyclones that form in this area can affect some of the various indian ocean island nations and or various countries along africa s east coast australian region edit tracks of all tropical cyclones in the southeastern indian ocean between 1980 and 2005 through the middle of 1985, this basin extended westward to 80e since then its western boundary has been 90e 30 tropical activity in this region affects australia and indonesia according to the australian bureau of meteorology the most frequently hit portion of australia is between exmouth and broome in western australia 32 the basin sees an average of about seven cyclones each year although more can form or come in from other basins such as the south pacific 6 33 34 the tropical cyclone cyclone vance in 1999 produced the highest recorded speed winds in an australian town or city at around 267 km h 166 mph  35 south pacific edit main article south pacific tropical cyclone season tracks of all tropical cyclones in the southwestern pacific ocean between 1980 and 2005 the south pacific ocean basin runs between 160°e and 120°w with tropical cyclones developing in it officially monitored by the fiji meteorological service and new zealand s metservice 36 tropical cyclones that develop within this basin generally affect countries to the west of the dateline though during el niños cyclones have been known to develop to the east of the dateline near french polynesia on average the basin sees nine tropical cyclones annually with about half of them becoming severe tropical cyclones south atlantic ocean edit see also south atlantic tropical cyclone hurricane catarina is currently the only known tropical cyclone in the south atlantic ocean to have actually reached hurricane intensity cyclones rarely form in other tropical ocean areas which are not formally considered tropical cyclone basins tropical depressions and tropical storms occur occasionally in the south atlantic and the only full-blown tropical cyclones on record were 2004 s hurricane catarina which made landfall in brazil and 2010 s tropical storm anita which formed off the coast of rio grande do sul the south atlantic ocean is not officially classified as a tropical cyclone basin by the world meteorological organization and does not have a designated regional specialized meteorological center rsmc  however the brazilian navy hydrographic center has started in 2011 to assign names to tropical and subtropical systems in this basin when they have sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km h 40 mph
