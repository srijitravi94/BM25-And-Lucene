portal v t e tropical cyclones are officially ranked on one of five tropical cyclone intensity scales according to their maximum sustained winds and which tropical cyclone basin s they are located in only a few scales of classifications are used officially by the meteorological agencies monitoring the tropical cyclones but some alternative scales also exist such as accumulated cyclone energy the power dissipation index the integrated kinetic energy index and the hurricane severity index tropical cyclones that develop in the northern hemisphere are officially classified by the warning centres on one of three intensity scales tropical cyclones or subtropical cyclones that exist within the north atlantic ocean or the north-eastern pacific ocean are classified as either tropical depressions or tropical storms should a system intensify further and become a hurricane then it will be classified on the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale which is based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 1-minute period in the western pacific the typhoon committee uses four separate classifications for tropical cyclones that exist within the basin which are based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 10-minute period the india meteorological department s scale uses 7 different classifications for systems within the north indian ocean and are based on the systems estimated 3-minute maximum sustained winds tropical cyclones that develop in the southern hemisphere are only officially classified by the warning centres on off two scales which are both based on 10-minute sustained wind speeds the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale which is used to classify systems within the australian or south pacific tropical cyclone basins the scale used to classify systems in the south-west indian ocean and is adapted by meteo france for use in various french territories including new caledonia and french polynesia the definition of sustained winds recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo and used by most weather agencies is that of a 10-minute average at a height of 10 m 33 ft  however the saffir–simpson hurricane scale is based on wind speed measurements averaged over a 1-minute period at 10 m 33 ft above the surface the scale used by rsmc new delhi applies a 3-minute averaging period and the australian scale is based on both 3-second wind gusts and maximum sustained winds averaged over a 10-minute interval these make direct comparisons between basins difficult within all basins tropical cyclones are named when the sustained winds hit 35 kn 40 mph 65 km h  background edit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be

subtropical waters with organized atmospheric convection and have a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation they are classified by the wind speeds located around the circulation centre and are ranked by the world meteorological organisation s regional specialized meteorological centers on one of five tropical cyclone scales the scale used for a particular tropical cyclone depends on what basin the system is located in with for example the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale and the australian tropical cyclone intensity scales both used in the western hemisphere all of the scales rank

either the national hurricane center or the central pacific hurricane center 1 within the region a tropical cyclone is defined to be a warm cored non-frontal synoptic disturbance that develops over tropical or subtropical waters with organized atmospheric convection and a closed well defined circulation centre 1 the region also defines a subtropical cyclone as a non-frontal low pressure disturbance that has the characteristics of both tropical and extratropical cyclones 1 once either of these classifications are met then advisories are initiated and the warning centers will classify the system as either a tropical or subtropical depression if the one-minute sustained winds estimated or measured as less than 33 kn 38 mph 62 km h  1 however if a tropical disturbance is capable of producing tropical storm or hurricane conditions on land within 48 hours then advisories will be initiated and it will be classified as a potential tropical cyclone 1 should the system intensify further or already have one-minute sustained winds of 34–63 kn 39–73 mph 63–118 km h  then it will be called either a tropical or subtropical storm and assigned a name 1 should the tropical system further intensify and have winds estimated or measured as greater than 64 kn 74 mph 119 km h  then it will be called a hurricane and classified on the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale 1 the lowest classification on the sshws is a category 1 hurricane which has winds of between 64–82 kn 74–95 mph 119–153 km h  1 2 should the hurricane intensify further then it will be rated as a category 2 hurricane if it has winds of between 83–95 kn 96–110 mph 154–177 km h  1 2 when a system becomes a category 3 hurricane with winds of between 96–112 kn 111–129 mph 178–208 km h  it is considered to be a major hurricane by the warning centers 2 a category 4 hurricane has winds of 113–136 kn 130–156 mph 209–251 km h  while a category 5 hurricane has winds of at least 137 kn 157 mph 252 km h  1 2 a post tropical cyclone is a system that has weakened into a remnant low or has dissipated and formal advisories are usually discontinued at this stage 1 however advisories may continue if the post tropical cyclone poses a significant threat to life and property 1 they may also continue if the remnants of the system have a chance of regeneration and producing tropical storm or hurricane-force winds over land within 48 hours 1 the sshs was originally created using both wind speed and storm surge but since the relationship between wind speed and storm surge is not necessarily definite the scale was changed to the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale sshws  based entirely on wind speed although increasing echelons of the scale correspond to stronger winds the rankings are not absolute in terms of effects lower-category storms can inflict greater damage than higher-category storms depending on factors such as local terrain population density and total rainfall for instance a category 2 hurricane that strikes a major urban area will likely do more damage than a large category 5 hurricane that strikes a mostly rural region in fact tropical systems of less than hurricane strength can produce significant damage and human casualties especially from flooding and landslides historically the term great hurricane was used to describe storms that possessed winds of at least 110 kn 125 mph 200 km h  large radii over 160 km 100 mi and that caused large amounts of destruction this term fell into disuse after the introduction of the saffir–simpson scale in the early 1970s 3 a minor change to the scale was made ahead of the 2012 hurricane season with the wind speeds for categories 3–5 tweaked to eliminate the rounding errors that had occurred during previous seasons when a hurricane had wind speeds of 115 kn 130 mph 215 km h  4 western pacific edit rsmc tokyo s tropical cyclone intensity scale category sustained winds violent typhoon ≥105 knots ≥194 km h very strong

classification used by the typhoon committee is a tropical depression which has 10-minute sustained winds of less than 33 kn 17 m s 38 mph 61 km h  5 should the tropical depression intensify further it is named and classified as a tropical storm which has winds speeds between 33–47 kn 17–24 m s 38–54 mph 61–87 km h  5 should the system continue to intensify further then it will be classified as a severe tropical storm which has winds speeds between 48–63 kn 25–32 m s 55–72 mph 89–117 km h  5 the highest classification on the typhoon committee s scale is a typhoon which has winds speeds greater than 64 kn 33 m s 74 mph 119 km h  5 the china meteorological administration the hong kong observatory hko  pagasa and the jma all divide the typhoon category further for domestic purposes 5 the jma divides the typhoon category into three categories with a 10-minute maximum wind speed below 84 kn 43 m s 97 mph 156 km h assigned for the strong typhoon category a very strong typhoon has wind speeds between 85–104 kn 44–54 m s 98–120 mph 157–193 km h  while a violent typhoon has wind speeds of 105 kn 54 m s 121 mph 194 km h or greater 5 the hko and the cma also divide the typhoon category into three categories with both assigning a maximum wind speed of 80 kn 41 m s 92 mph 150 km h to the typhoon category a severe typhoon has wind speeds of 85–104 kn 44–54 m s 98–120 mph 157–193 km h  while a super typhoon has winds of 100 kn 51 m s 120 mph 190 km h  5 6 during may 2015 pagasa introduced the term super typhoon and used it for systems with winds greater than 120 kn 62 m s 140 mph 220 km h  7 in addition to the national meteorological services of each nation the united states joint typhoon warning center monitors the basin and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones for the united states government 8 these warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale however the jtwc uses their own scale for intensity classifications in this basin 9 these classifications are tropical depression tropical storm typhoon and super typhoon 9 in addition the taiwan central weather bureau has its own scale in chinese but

convection and a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation 11 the lowest official classification used in the north indian ocean is a depression which has 3-minute sustained wind speeds of between 17–27 kn 20–31 mph 31–49 km h  11 should the depression intensify further then it will become a deep depression which has winds between 28–33 kn 32–38 mph 50–61 km h  11 the system will be classified as a cyclonic storm and assigned a name by the imd if it should develop gale-force wind speeds of between 34–47 kn 39–54 mph 62–88 km h  11 severe cyclonic storms have storm force wind speeds of

historically a system has been classified as a depression if it is an area where the barometric pressure is low compared with its surroundings 12 other classifications historically used include cyclonic storm where the winds did not exceed force 10 on the beaufort scale and a cyclone where the winds are either force 11 and 12 on the beaufort scale 12 between 1924 and 1988, tropical cyclones were classified into four categories depression deep depression cyclonic storms and severe cyclonic storms 12 however a change was made during 1988 to introduce the category severe cyclonic storm with core of hurricane winds for tropical cyclones with wind speeds of more than 64 kn 74 mph 119 km h  12 during 1999 the categories very severe cyclonic storm and super cyclonic storm were introduced while the severe cyclonic storm with a core of hurricane winds category was eliminated 12 during 2015 another modification to the intensity scale took place with the imd calling a system with 3-minute maximum sustained wind speeds between 90–119 kn 166–221 km h 104–137 mph an extremely severe cyclonic storm 13 the united states joint typhoon warning center also monitors the basin and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the united states government 8 these warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale

originating over tropical or sub-tropical waters with organized convection and definite cyclonic surface wind circulation with the average wind speed estimated to be not exceeding 27 knots 50 km h  a tropical disturbance is mfr s generic term for a non-frontal area of low pressure that has organized convection and definite cyclonic surface wind circulation 14 the system should be estimated to have wind speeds of less than 28 knots 50 km h 32 mph  14 a system is designated as a tropical depression or a subtropical depression when it reaches wind speeds above 28 knots 50 km h 32 mph  should a tropical depression reach wind speeds of 35 knots 65 km h 40 mph then it will be classified as a moderate tropical storm and assigned a name by either the sub regional center in mauritius or madagascar no matter how strong a subtropical system is in this basin it is always designated as a subtropical depression 15 should the named storm intensify further and reach winds speeds of 48 knots 89 km h 55 mph  then it will be classified as a severe tropical storm 15 a severe tropical storm is designated as a tropical cyclone when it reaches wind speeds of 64 knots 118 km h 74 mph  14 should a tropical cyclone intensify further and reach wind speeds of 90 knots 166 km h 103 mph  it will be classified as an intense tropical cyclone 14 a very intense tropical cyclone is the highest category on the south-west indian ocean tropical cyclone scale and has winds of over 115 knots 212 km h 132 mph  15 at the tenth ra i tropical cyclone committee held during 1991, it was recommended that the intensity classifications be changed ahead of the 1993–94 tropical cyclone season 16 specifically it was decided that the classifications weak tropical depression moderate tropical depression and severe tropical depression would be changed to tropical depression moderate tropical storm and severe tropical storm 16 this change was implemented ahead of the 1993–94 tropical cyclone season 16 the united states joint typhoon warning center also monitors the basin and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the united states government 8 these warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale however regardless of intensity in this basin the jtwc labels all systems as tropical cyclones 9 australia and fiji

officially monitored by one or more tropical cyclone warning centres 17 these are run by the fiji meteorological service new zealand s metservice indonesia s badan meteorologi klimatologi dan geofisika papua new guinea s national weather service while three others are run by the australian bureau of meteorology 17 within the region a tropical cyclone is defined as being a non-frontal low pressure system of synoptic scale that develops over warm waters with a definite organized wind circulation and 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 34 kn 63 km h 39 mph or greater near the centre 17 once this definition has been met then all of the centres name the system and start to use the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale which measures tropical cyclones using a five category system based on 10-minute maximum sustained winds 17 18 a category 1 tropical cyclone is estimated to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 34–47 kn 39–54 mph 63–87 km h  while a category 2 tropical cyclone is estimated to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 48–63 kn 55–72 mph 89–117 km h  18 19 when a system becomes a category 3 tropical cyclone it is reclassified as a severe tropical cyclone and has wind speeds of 64–85 kn 74–98 mph 119–157 km h  18 19 a category 4 severe tropical cyclone has winds of 86–110 kn 99–130 mph 157–200 km h  while the maximum rating is a category 5 severe tropical cyclone which has winds of at least 110 kn 130 mph 200 km h  18 19 for systems below tropical cyclone strength there are various terms used including tropical disturbance tropical low and tropical depression 17 a tropical disturbance is defined as being a non – frontal system of synoptic scale originating over the tropics with persistent enhanced convection and or some indication of a circulation 17 a tropical depression or tropical low is a disturbance with a defined circulation where the central position can be estimated and the maximum 10-minute average wind speed is less than 34 kn 39 mph 63 km h near the centre 17 the fms numbers these systems when they have a potential to develop into a tropical cyclone or persist to cause significant impact to life and property within its area of responsibility and have been analysed for the previous 24 hours 17 the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale was introduced by the bom ahead of the 1989–90 cyclone season the united states joint typhoon warning center also monitors the basin and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the united states government 8 these warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale however regardless of intensity in these basins the jtwc labels all systems as tropical cyclones 9 alternative scales edit there are other scales that are not officially used by any of the regional specialized meteorological centres or the tropical cyclone warning centres however they are used by other organizations such as the national oceanic and atmospheric administration an example of such scale is the integrated kinetic energy index which measures the destructive potential of the storm surge it works on a scale that ranges from one to six with six having the highest destructive potential 20 accumulated cyclone energy ace is used by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and other agencies to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones that are above tropical storm strength and entire tropical cyclone seasons 21 it is calculated by taking the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical storm wind speed 35 knots or higher at six-hour intervals 21 the numbers are usually divided by 10,000 to make them more manageable the unit of ace is 104 kn2 and for use as an index the unit is assumed 21 as well as being squared for ace wind speed can also be cubed which is referred to as the power dissipation index pdi  22 the hurricane severity index hsi is another scale used and rates the severity of all types of tropical and subtropical cyclones based on both the intensity and the size of their wind fields 23 the hsi is a 0 to 50 point scale allotting up to 25 points for a tropical cyclone s intensity and up to 25 points for wind field size 23 points are awarded on a sliding scale with the majority of points reserved for hurricane force and greater wind fields 23 comparisons across basins edit the terminology for tropical cyclones differs from one region to another below is a summary of the classifications used by
