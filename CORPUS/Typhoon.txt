typhoon - wikipedia typhoon from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article is about northwestern pacific tropical cyclones for other uses see typhoon disambiguation  for other areas in which tropical cyclones occur see tropical cyclone basins three different tropical cyclones spinning over the western pacific ocean on august 7, 2006 maria bopha saomai  the cyclone on the lower right has intensified into a typhoon a typhoon is a mature tropical cyclone that develops between 180° and 100°e this region is referred to as the northwestern pacific basin 1 and is the most active tropical cyclone basin on earth accounting for almost one-third of the world s annual tropical cyclones for organizational purposes the northern pacific ocean is divided into three regions the eastern north america to 140°w  central 140° to 180°w  and western 180° to 100°e  the regional specialized meteorological center rsmc for tropical cyclone forecasts is in japan with other tropical cyclone warning centers for the northwest pacific in hawaii the joint typhoon warning center  the philippines and hong kong while the rsmc names each system the main name list itself is coordinated among 18 countries that have territories threatened by typhoons each year only the philippines use their own naming list for systems approaching the country citation needed  a typhoon differs from a cyclone or hurricane only on the basis of location 2 a hurricane is a storm that occurs in the atlantic ocean and northeastern pacific ocean a typhoon occurs in the northwestern pacific ocean and a cyclone occurs in the south pacific or indian ocean 2 within the northwestern pacific there are no official typhoon seasons as tropical cyclones form throughout the year like any tropical cyclone there are six main requirements for typhoon formation and development sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures atmospheric instability high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere enough coriolis force to develop a low pressure center a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance and low vertical wind shear while the majority of storms form between june and november a few storms do occur between december and may although tropical cyclone formation is at a minimum during that time  on average the northwestern pacific features the most numerous and intense tropical cyclones globally like other basins they are steered by the subtropical ridge towards the west or northwest with some systems recurving near and east of japan the philippines receive the brunt of the landfalls with china and japan being impacted slightly less some of the deadliest typhoons in history have struck china southern china has the longest record of typhoon impacts for the region with a thousand-year sample via documents within their archives taiwan has received the wettest known typhoon on record for the northwest pacific tropical cyclone basins nomenclature edit etymology and usage edit the term typhoon is the regional name in the northwest pacific for a severe or mature tropical cyclone 3 whereas hurricane is the regional term in the northeast pacific and northern atlantic 4 elsewhere this is called a tropical cyclone severe tropical cyclone or severe cyclonic storm 5 the oxford english dictionary 6 cites urdu ṭūfān and chinese tai fung giving rise to several early forms in english the earliest forms -- touffon  later tufan  tuffon  and others -- derive from urdu ṭūfān with citations as early as 1588. from 1699 appears tuffoon  later tiffoon  derived from chinese with spelling influenced by the older urdu-derived forms the modern spelling typhoon dates to 1820, preceded by tay-fun in 1771 and ty-foong  all derived from the chinese tai fung the urdu source word توفان ṭūfān violent storm cognate to hindi तूफ़ान tūfān 7 comes via persian from arabic طوفان ṭūfān  which may derive from the verb tūfīdan persian توفیدن طوفیدن‎‎ to roar to blow furiously citation needed or arabic ṭāfa to turn round 6 the chinese source is the word tai fung 7 simplified chinese 台风 traditional chinese 颱風 pinyin táifēng  cited as a common dialect form of mandarin dà big and fēng wind  6 in mandarin the word for the windstorm is 大风 dàfēng big wind and in cantonese 大風 daai6 fung1 big wind  the modern japanese word 台風 たいふう taifuu  is also derived from chinese the first character is normally used to mean pedestal or stand  but is actually a simplification of the older kanji 颱 which means typhoon thus the word originally meant typhoon wind  the ancient greek τυφῶν tuphôn typhon is not unrelated and has secondarily contaminated the word 7 the persian and chinese terms may have been originated by the greek word in the first place 6 8 intensity classifications edit rsmc tokyo s tropical cyclone intensity scale category sustained winds violent typhoon ≥105 knots ≥194 km h very strong typhoon 85–104 knots 157–193 km h typhoon 64–84 knots 118–156 km h severe tropical storm 48–63 knots 89–117 km h tropical storm 34–47 knots 62–88 km h tropical depression ≤33 knots ≤61 km h see also tropical cyclone scales a tropical depression is the lowest category that the japan meteorological agency uses and is the term used for a tropical system that has wind speeds not exceeding 33 knots 38 mph 61 km h  9 a tropical depression is upgraded to a tropical storm should its sustained wind speeds exceed 34 knots 39 mph 63 km h  tropical storms also receive official names from rsmc tokyo 9 should the storm intensify further and reach sustained wind speeds of 48 knots 55 mph 89 km h then it will be classified as a severe tropical storm 9 once the system s maximum sustained winds reach wind speeds of 64 knots 74 mph 119 km h  the jma will designate the tropical cyclone as a typhoon—the highest category on its scale 9 from 2009 the hong kong observatory started to further divide typhoons into three different classifications typhoon severe typhoon and super typhoon 10 a typhoon has wind speed of 64-79 knots 73-91 mph 118–149 km h  a severe typhoon has winds of at least 80 knots 92 mph 150 km h  and a super typhoon has winds of at least 100 knots 120 mph 190 km h  10 the united states joint typhoon warning center jtwc unofficially classifies typhoons with wind speeds of at least 130 knots 67 m s 150 mph 241 km h —the equivalent of a strong category 4 storm in the saffir-simpson scale—as super typhoons 11 however the maximum sustained wind speed measurements that the jtwc uses are based on a 1-minute averaging period akin to the u.s national hurricane center and central pacific hurricane center as a result the jtwc s wind reports are higher than jma s measurements as the latter are based on a 10-minute averaging interval 12 genesis edit depth of 26 °c isotherm on october 1, 2006 see also tropical cyclogenesis there are six main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures atmospheric instability high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere enough coriolis force to develop a low pressure center a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance and low vertical wind shear while these conditions are necessary for tropical cyclone formation they do not guarantee that a tropical cyclone will form normally an ocean temperature of 26.5 °c 79.7 °f spanning through a depth of at least 50 metres 160 ft is considered the minimum to maintain the special mesocyclone that is the tropical cyclone citation needed these warm waters are needed to maintain the warm core that fuels tropical systems a minimum distance of 500 km 300 mi from the equator is normally needed for tropical cyclogenesis 13 whether it be a depression in the intertropical convergence zone itcz or monsoon trough a broad surface front or an outflow boundary a low level feature with sufficient vorticity and convergence is required to begin tropical cyclogenesis about 85 to 90 percent of pacific typhoons form within the monsoon trough 14 even with perfect upper level conditions and the required atmospheric instability the lack of a surface focus will prevent the development of organized convection and a surface low vertical wind shear of less than 10 m s 20 kn 33 ft s between the ocean surface and the tropopause is required for tropical cyclone development 13 typically with pacific typhoons there are two outflow jets one to the north ahead of an upper trough in the westerlies and a second towards the equator 14 in general westerly wind increases associated with the madden–julian oscillation lead to increased tropical cyclogenesis in all tropical cyclone basins as the oscillation propagates from west to east it leads to an eastward march in tropical cyclogenesis with time during that hemisphere s summer season 15 on average twice per year twin tropical cyclones will form in the western pacific ocean near the 5th parallel north and the 5th parallel south along the same meridian or line of longitude 16 there is an inverse relationship between tropical cyclone activity in the western pacific basin and the north atlantic basin however when one basin is active the other is normally quiet and vice versa the main reason for this appears to be the phase of the madden–julian oscillation or mjo which is normally in opposite modes between the two basins at any given time 17 frequency edit storm frequency

19 pacific typhoons have formed year round with peak months from august to october the peak months correspond to that of the atlantic hurricane seasons along with a high storm frequency this basin also features the most globally intense storms on record one of the most recent busy seasons was 2013. tropical cyclones form in any month of the year across the northwest pacific ocean and concentrate around june and november in the northern indian ocean the area just northeast of the philippines is the most active place on earth for tropical cyclones to exist across the philippines themselves activity reaches a minimum in february before increasing steadily through june and spiking from july through october with september being the most active month for tropical cyclones across the archipelago activity falls off significantly in november although typhoon haiyan the strongest philippine typhoon on record was a november typhoon 20 the most frequently impacted areas of the philippines by tropical cyclones are northern and central luzon and eastern visayas 21 a ten-year average of satellite determined precipitation showed that at least 30 percent of the annual rainfall in the northern philippines could be traced to tropical cyclones while the southern islands receive less than 10 percent of their annual rainfall from tropical cyclones 22 the genesis and intensity of typhoons are also modulated by slow variation of the sea surface temperature and circulation features following a near-10-year frequency 23 paths edit see also hurricane belt tracks of all tropical cyclones in the northernwestern pacific ocean between 1980 and 2005. the vertical line to the right is the international date line most tropical cyclones form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving north and northeast into the main belt of the westerlies 24 when the subtropical ridge shifts due to el niño so will the preferred tropical cyclone tracks areas west of japan and korea tend to experience many fewer september–november tropical cyclone impacts during el niño and neutral years during el niño years the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130°e which would favor the japanese archipelago 25 during la niña years the formation of tropical cyclones and the subtropical ridge position shift westward across the western pacific ocean which increases the landfall threat to china and greater intensity to philippines 25 those that form near the marshall islands find their way to jeju island korea 26 typhoon paths follow three general directions 19 straight track or straight runner  a general westward path affects the philippines southern china taiwan and vietnam a parabolic recurving track storms recurving affect eastern philippines eastern china taiwan korea japan and the russian far east northward track from point of origin the storm follows a northerly direction only affecting small islands a rare few storms like hurricane john were redesignated as typhoons as they originated in the eastern central pacific and moved into the western pacific basin monitoring edit within the western pacific rsmc tokyo-typhoon center part of the japan meteorological agency has had the official warning responsibility for the whole of the western pacific since 1989, 27 and the naming responsibility for systems of tropical storm strength or greater since 2000. 10 however each national meteorological and hydrological service within the western pacific has the responsibility for issuing warnings for land areas about tropical cyclones affecting their country such as the joint typhoon warning center for united states agencies 28 the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa for interests in the island archipelago nation 29 and the hong kong observatory for storms that come close enough to cause the issuance of warning signals 30 name sources edit the list of names consists of entries from 17 southeast and east asian nations and the united states who have territories directly affected by typhoons the submitted names are arranged into five lists and each list is cycled with each year unlike tropical cyclones in other parts of the world typhoons are not named after people instead they generally refer to animals flowers astrological signs and a few personal names however pagasa retains its own naming list which does consist of human names 31 therefore a typhoon can possibly have two names storms that cross the date line from the central pacific retain their original name but the designation of hurricane becomes typhoon in japan people use the numerical designation of typhoons according to the sequence of their occurrence in the calendar year 27 records edit total storms year tropical storms typhoons super typhoons 39 1964 13 19 7 35 1965 1967 1971 14 15 11 10 16 16 11 4 4 34 1994 14 14 6 33 1996 12 15 6 32

39 storms of tropical storm strength formed only 15 seasons had 30 or more storms developing since reliable records began the least activity seen in the northwest pacific ocean was during the 2010 pacific typhoon season when only 14 tropical storms and seven typhoons formed in the philippines the most active season since 1945, for tropical cyclone strikes was 1993 when nineteen tropical cyclones moved through the country 32 there was only one tropical cyclone that moved through the philippines in 1958. 33 the 2004 pacific typhoon season was the busiest for okinawa since 1957. 34 within guangdong in southern china during the past thousand years the most active decades for typhoon strikes were the 1660s and 1670s 35 the highest reliably-estimated maximum sustained winds on record for a typhoon were those of typhoon haiyan at 195 miles per hour 314 km h shortly before its landfall in the central philippines on nov 8, 2013. 36 the most intense storm based on minimum pressure was typhoon tip in the northwestern pacific ocean in 1979, which reached a minimum pressure of 870 hectopascals 26 inhg and maximum sustained wind speeds of 165 knots 85 m s 190 mph 310 km h  37 the deadliest typhoon of the 20th century was typhoon nina which killed nearly 100,000 in china in 1975 due to a flood that caused 12 reservoirs to fail 38 after typhoon morakot landed in taiwan at midnight on august 8, 2009, almost the entire southern region of taiwan chiayi county chiayi city tainan county tainan city now merged as tainan  kaohsiung county kaohsiung city now merged as kaohsiung  and pingtung county and parts of taitung county and nantou county were flooded by record-breaking heavy rain the rainfall in pingtung county reached 2,327 millimeters 91.6 in  39 breaking all rainfall records of any single place in taiwan induced by a single typhoon 40 and making the cyclone the wettest known typhoon
