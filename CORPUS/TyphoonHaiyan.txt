storm surge many residents in the building were caught off-guard by the fast rising waters and subsequently drowned or were injured in the building 68 although wind speeds were extreme the major cause of damage and loss of life appears to have been storm surge the major focus of devastation appears to have been on the east coast of samar and leyte with a particular focus on tacloban because of its location between samar and leyte and the large population in low-lying areas 59 philippine department of the interior and local government dilg secretary mar roxas said the scale of the relief operation that was now required was overwhelming with some places described as a wasteland of mud and debris 69 sebastian rhodes stampa head of a un disaster assessment co-ordination team said there was destruction on a massive scale in tacloban there are cars thrown like tumbleweed and the streets are strewn with debris the last time i saw something of this scale was in the aftermath of the 2004

that while many survivors requiring medical attention in the first week suffer from trauma and fractures the concern shifts toward chronic conditions as the weeks pass the who coordinated the massive international response to help the philippine government meet the acute need for healthcare services in the affected areas 87 extreme damage to infrastructure throughout the region posed logistical problems that greatly slowed relief efforts though aid was flown into local airports most of it remained there as roads remained closed 88 according to estimates on november 13, only 20 percent of the affected population in tacloban city was receiving aid with lack of access to clean water some residents dug up water pipes and boiled water from there in order to survive thousands of people sought to evacuate the city via c-130 cargo planes however the slow process fueled further aggravation reports of escaped prisoners raping women in the city prompted a further urgency to evacuate one resident was quoted as saying tacloban is a dead city 53 due to the lack of electricity planes could only operate during the daylight further slowing the evacuations at dawn on november 12, thousands of people broke through fences and rushed planes only to be forced back by police and military personnel a similar incident occurred later that day as a u.s cargo plane was landing 89 on november 14, a correspondent from the bbc reported tacloban to be a war zone although the situation soon stabilized when the presence of government law enforcement was increased safety concerns prompted several relief agencies to back out of the operation and some united nations staff were pulled out for safety reasons a message circulating among the agencies urged them to not go into tacloban for this reason 90 on the west coast of leyte island residents in ormoc were fearing that the focus on tacloban city would leave them without aid though not as hard hit roughly 90 percent of the city was damaged or destroyed and supplies were running low hospitals in the city were either shut down or working at partial capacity leaving many of the nearly 2,000 injured in the city without medical assistance in nearby baybay lack of assistance fueled anger and incited looting for survival 91 in the coastal community guiuan which took the full brunt of the typhoon mayor christopher gonzalez is credited with saving countless lives after he incessantly urged residents to evacuate he referred to the storm as delubyo deluge  which roughly translates to armageddon of the town s 45,000 residents

officers were dispatched to assist 102 security checkpoints had since been set up all over tacloban and a curfew was imposed on residents to prevent more attacks 103 philippine military forces also prevented members of the new people s army from ambushing a relief convoy bound for samar in matnog sorsogon killing two 104 president benigno aquino iii considered declaring martial law in hopes of restoring order in affected areas 105 106 looting intensified as slow recovery efforts forced residents to seek any means necessary to survive tacloban city administrator tecson john lim stated the looting is not criminality it is self-preservation the chicago tribune reported that some areas were on the brink of anarchy though interior secretary mar roxas denied such claims 53 further complicating efforts to retain order was the lack of officers reporting for work in tacloban only 100 of the city s 1,300 police personnel reported for duty 89 in alangalang just west of tacloban eight people were crushed to death after the walls of a warehouse collapsed during a raid on a government rice stockpile approximately 33,000 bags of rice each weighing 50 kg 110 lb  were stolen

response to the typhoon mounted days after the storm had passed media reports criticized the aquino administration for apparent lack of preparation and coordination among government agencies in the aid operation 107 108 up until november 12, five days after the typhoon struck survivors continued to struggle with basic necessities such as food water and shelter while remote towns in leyte and samar were yet to be reached by aid 109 the philippine government responded by saying that they have dealt with the tragedy quite well but the response had been slow due to the breakdown of the local governance in affected areas where officials and employees who were usually the first to respond in these events were victims of the typhoon themselves 110 cabinet secretary jose rene almendras said that the national government had to take over despite logistical challenges and assured it is working toward providing aid the quickest way possible to the survivors 111 the national government was also criticized for putting the responsibility of handling the dead to the bureau of fire instead to the department of health dr racquel fortun one of the forensic experts to go to the area three days after the typhoon insisted that handling of the bodies is a health matter and therefore a responsibility of doh 112 one of the biggest controversies of typhoon haiyan is probably the number of the victims or the body count according to the philippine government sources the number of those killed during the typhoon ranges from 4,000 to 6,000 individuals while some sources claim that the body count reaches up to 15,000. 113 114 115 humanitarian crisis and population displacement edit the philippines faced a humanitarian crisis days after the typhoon hit much of the visayas with 1.9 million

united nations fear that the possibility of the spread of disease is high due to the lack of food water shelter and medication casualties have been reported as a result of the lack of aid in affected areas and the number of dead is likely to rise 118 as a result of the damage in tacloban and much of leyte thousands of people who once lived in the area left and made their way into less affected
