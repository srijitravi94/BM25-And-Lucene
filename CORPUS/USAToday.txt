and format edit this february 5, 2009 issue of usa today shows the old layout and logo of the paper prior to its 2012 redesign usa today is known for synthesizing news down to easy-to-read-and-comprehend stories in the main edition circulated in the united states and some canadian cities each edition consists of four sections news the oft-labeled front page section  money sports and life since march 1998, the friday edition of life has been separated into two distinct sections the regular life focusing on entertainment subtitled weekend section e  which features television reviews and listings a dvd column film reviews and trends and a travel supplement called destinations diversions section d  the international edition of the paper features two sections news and money in one with sports and life in the other atypical of most daily newspapers the paper does not print on saturdays and sundays the friday edition serves as the weekend edition although usa today has published special saturday and sunday editions in the past the first being published on january 19, 1991, when it released a saturday extra edition updating coverage of the gulf war from the previous day the paper published special seven-day-a-week editions for the first time on july 19, 1996, when it published special editions for exclusive distribution in the host city of atlanta and surrounding areas for the two-week duration of the summer olympics  9 usa today prints each complete story on the front page of the respective section with the exception of the cover story the cover story is a longer story that requires a jump readers must turn to another page in the paper to complete the story usually the next page of that section  on certain days the news or sports section will take up two paper sections and there will be a second cover story within the second section each section is denoted by a certain color to differentiate sections beyond lettering and is seen in a box the top-left corner of the first page the principal section colors are blue for news section a  green for money section b  red for sports section c  and purple for life section d in the paper s early years the life and money sections were also assigned blue nameplates and spot color as the presses used at usa today printing facilities did not yet accommodate the use of other colors to denote all four original sections 29 orange is used for bonus sections section e or above  which are published occasionally such as for business travel trends and the olympics other bonus sections for sports such as for the pga tour preview ncaa basketball tournaments memorial day auto races indianapolis 500 and coca-cola 600  nfl opening weekend and the super bowl previously used the orange color but now use the red designated for sports in their bonus sections to increase their ties to usa today gannett incorporated the usa today coloring scheme into an internally created graphics package for news programming that the company began phasing in across its television station group – which were spun-off in july 2015 into the separate broadcast and digital media company tegna – in late 2012 the package utilizes the color scheme for a rundown graphic used on most stations – outside of those that gannett acquired in 2014 from london broadcasting which began implementing the package in late 2015 – that persists throughout its stations newscasts as well as bumpers for individual story topics  gannett s television stations began to a new on-air appearance that uses a color-coding system identical to that of the paper 30 original logo used from 1982 to 2012. in many ways usa today is set up to break the typical newspaper layout some examples of that divergence from tradition include using the left-hand quarter of each section as reefers front-page paragraphs referring to stories on inside pages 31  sometimes using sentence-length blurbs to describe stories inside the lead reefer is the cover page feature newsline which shows summarized descriptions of headline stories featured in all four main sections and any special sections as a national newspaper usa today cannot focus on the weather for any one city therefore the entire back page of the news section is used for weather maps for the continental united states puerto rico and the united states virgin islands and temperature lists for many cities throughout the u.s and the world temperatures for individual cities on the primary forecast map and temperature lists are suffixed with a one- or two-letter code such as t for thunderstorms referencing the expected weather conditions the colorized forecast map originally created by staff designer george rorick who left usa today for a similar position at the detroit news in 1986  was copied by newspapers around the world breaking from the traditional style of using monochrome contouring or simplistic text to denote temperature ranges 11 32 national precipitation maps for the next three days previously five days until the 2012 redesign  and four-day forecasts and air quality indexes for 36 major u.s cities originally 16 cities prior to 1999 – with individual cities color-coded by the temperature contour corresponding to the given area on the forecast map – are also featured weather data is provided by accuweather which has served as the forecast provider for usa today for most of the paper s existence with an exception from january 2002 to september 2012, when the weather channel provided data through a long-term multimedia content agreement with gannett  33 34 35 36 37 in the bottom left-hand corner of the weather page is weather focus  a graphic which explains various meteorological phenomena on some days the weather focus could be a photo of a rare meteorological event on mondays the money section uses its back page for market trends a feature that launched in june 2002 and presents an unusual graphic depicting the performance of various industry groups as a function of quarterly monthly and weekly movements against the s p 500. on days featuring bonus sections or business holidays the money and life sections are usually combined into one section while combinations of the friday life editions into one section are common during quiet weeks advertising coverage is seen in the monday money section which often includes a review of a current television ad and after super bowl sunday a review of the ads aired during the broadcast with the results of the ad track live survey stock tables for individual stock exchanges comprising one subsection for companies traded on the new york stock exchange and another for companies trading on nasdaq and the american stock exchange and mutual indexes were discontinued with the 2012 redesign due to the myriad of electronic ways to check individual stock prices in line with most newspapers book coverage including reviews and a national sales chart the latter of which debuted on october 28, 1994  is seen on thursdays in life with the official full a.c nielsen television ratings chart printed on wednesdays or thursdays depending on release the paper also publishes the mediabase survey for several genres of music based on radio airplay spins on tuesdays along with their own chart of the top ten singles in general on wednesdays because of the same limitations cited for its nationalized forecasts the television page in life – which provides prime time and late night listings running from 8 00 p.m to 12 30 a.m eastern time – incorporates a boilerplate local news or local programming descriptions to denote time periods in which the five major english language broadcast networks abc nbc cbs fox and the cw cede airtime to allow their affiliates to carry syndicated programs or local newscasts the television page has never been accompanied by a weekly listings supplement with broader scheduling information similar to those featured in local newspapers like most national papers usa today does not carry comic strips usa today is headquartered in tysons corner virginia one of the staples of the news section is across the usa a state-by-state roundup of headlines the summaries consist of paragraph-length associated press reports highlighting one story of note in each state the district of columbia and one u.s territory similarly the for the record page of the sports section which features sports scores for both the previous four days of league play and individual non-league events seasonal league statistics and wagering lines for the current day s games also features a rundown of winning numbers from the previous deadline date for all participating state lotteries and individual multi-state lotteries some traditions have been retained however the lead story still appears on the upper-right hand of the front page commentary and political cartoons occupy the last few pages of the news section stock and mutual fund data are presented in the money section but usa today is sufficiently different in aesthetics to be recognized on sight even in a mix of other newspapers such as at a newsstand the overall design and layout of usa today has been described as neo-victorian 38 also in most of the sections front pages on the lower left hand corner are usa today snapshots  which give statistics of various lifestyle interests according to the section it is in for example a snapshot in life could show how many people tend to watch a certain genre of television show based upon the type of mood they are in at the time  these snapshots are shown through graphs which are made up of various illustrations of objects that roughly pertain to the graphs subject matter using the example above the graph s bars could be made up of several tv sets or ended by one  these are usually loosely based on research by a national institute with the credited source mentioned in fine print in the box below the graph  the newspaper also features an occasional magazine supplement called open air which launched on march 7, 2008 and appears several times a year various other advertorials appear throughout the year mainly on fridays opinion section edit the opinion section prints usa today editorials columns by guest writers and members of the editorial board of contributors 39 letters to the editor and editorial cartoons one unique feature of

newspaper s website calls this group demographically and ideologically diverse 40 usa today has traditionally maintained a policy not to endorse candidates for the united states presidency or any other state or federal political office which it has refrained from doing since its inception since 1984, its political editorials during the presidential election cycle has focused instead on providing opinion on major issues relevant to the campaign based on the differing concerns of voters the vast amount of information on ongoing presidential campaigns and the board of contributors aim to provide a fair viewpoint through the diverse political ideologies of its members and avoid reader perceptions of bias however the board re-evaluates its non-endorsement policy through an independent process during each four-year election cycle with any decision to circumvent the policy based on a consensus vote in which fewer than two of the editorial board s members dissent or hold differing opinions 42 the editorial board broke from this stance for the first time on september 29, 2016, when it published an op-ed piece condemning the candidacy of republican nominee donald trump calling him unfit for the presidency due to his inflammatory campaign rhetoric particularly that aimed at military veterans immigrants and various ethnic and religious groups his temperament and lack of financial transparency his checkered business record his use of false and hyperbolic statements the inconsistency of his viewpoints and issues with his vision on domestic and foreign policy and based on comments he has made during his campaign and criticisms by both democrats and republicans on these views the potential risks to national security and constitutional ethics under a trump administration asking voters to resist the siren song of a dangerous demagogue  43 the board noted that the piece was not a qualified endorsement of democratic nominee hillary clinton for whom the board was unable to reach a consensus for endorsing some editorial board members expressed that clinton s public service record would help her serve the nation ably as its president while others had serious reservations about her sense of entitlement . lack of candor and . extreme carelessness in handling classified information  instead advising voters to decide whether to vote for clinton
