washington 18 the navy was rooted in the colonial seafaring tradition which produced a large community of sailors captains and shipbuilders 19 in the early stages of the american revolutionary war massachusetts had its own massachusetts naval militia the rationale for establishing a national navy was debated in the second continental congress supporters argued that a navy would protect shipping defend the coast and make it easier to seek out support from foreign countries detractors countered that challenging the british royal navy then the world s preeminent naval power was a foolish undertaking commander in chief george washington resolved the debate when he commissioned the ocean-going schooner uss hannah to interdict british merchant ships and reported the captures to the congress on 13 october 1775, the continental congress authorized the purchase of two vessels to be armed for a cruise against british merchant ships this resolution created the continental navy and is considered the first establishment of the u.s navy 20 the continental navy achieved mixed results it was successful in a number of engagements and raided many british merchant vessels but it lost twenty-four of its vessels 21 and at one point was reduced to two in active service 22 in august 1785, after the revolutionary war had drawn to a close congress had sold alliance the last ship remaining in the continental navy due to a lack of funds to maintain the ship or support a navy 23 24 in 1972, the chief of naval operations admiral elmo zumwalt authorized the navy to celebrate its

war of 1812, where it was victorious in eleven single-ship duels with the royal navy it drove all significant british forces off lake erie and lake champlain and prevented them from becoming british-controlled zones the result was a major defeat for the british invasion of new york state and the defeat of the military threat from the native american allies of the british despite this the u.s navy was unable to prevent the british from blockading its ports and landing troops 29 after the war the u.s navy again focused its attention on protecting american shipping assets sending
