university building c 1870 founding edit in 1854, territorial governor isaac stevens recommended the establishment of a university in washington prominent seattle-area residents including methodist preacher daniel bagley saw this as a chance to add to the city s potential and prestige they convinced early founder of seattle and member of the territorial legislature  arthur a denny on the importance of the school two universities were initially chartered but later the decision was repealed in favor of a single university in lewis county provided that locally donated land was available when no site emerged denny successfully petitioned the legislature to reconsider seattle as a location in 1858. in 1861, scouting began for an appropriate 10 acres 4 ha site in seattle to serve as a new university campus arthur and mary denny donated eight acres while fellow pioneers edward lander and charlie and mary terry donated two acres on denny s knoll in downtown seattle 7 more specifically this tract was bounded by 4th avenue to the west 6th avenue to the east union street to the north and seneca streets to the south on november 4, 1861, washington opened as the territorial university of washington the legislature passed articles incorporating the university and establishing its board of regents in 1862. the school initially struggled closing three times in 1863 for low enrollment and again in 1867 and 1876 due to funds shortage washington successfully awarded its first graduate clara antoinette mccarty wilt in 1876, with a bachelor s degree in science 19th century relocation edit by the time washington state entered the union in 1889, both seattle and the university had grown substantially washington s total undergraduate enrollment increased from 30 to nearly 300 students and the campus s relative isolation in downtown seattle faced encroaching development a special legislative committee headed by uw graduate edmond meany was created to find a new campus to better serve the growing student population and faculty the committee eventually selected a site on the northeast of downtown seattle called union bay and the legislature appropriated funds for its purchase and construction alaska-yukon-pacific exposition on the uw campus toward mount rainier in 1909 in 1895, the university relocated to the new campus by moving into the newly built denny hall the university regents tried and failed to sell the old campus eventually settling with leasing the area this would later become one of the university s most valuable pieces of real estate in modern-day seattle generating millions in annual revenue with what is now called the metropolitan tract the original territorial university building was torn down in 1908, and its former site now houses the fairmont olympic hotel the sole-surviving remnants of washington s first building are four 24-foot 7.3 m  white hand-fluted cedar ionic columns they were salvaged by edmond s meany one of the university s first graduates and former head of its history department meany and his colleague dean herbert t condon dubbed the columns as loyalty industry faith  and efficiency  or life the columns now stand in the sylvan grove theater 8 20th century expansion edit organizers of the 1909 alaska-yukon-pacific exposition eyed the still largely undeveloped campus as a prime setting for their world s fair they came to an agreement with washington s board of regents that allowed them to use the campus grounds for the exposition in exchange washington would take advantage of the campus and its development after the fair s conclusion this arrangement led to a detailed site plan and several buildings prepared in part by john charles olmsted the plan was later incorporated into the overall campus master plan permanently affecting the campus layout aerial view of campus circa 1922 both world wars brought the military to campus with certain facilities temporarily loaned to the
