veracruz has 690 km 429 mi of coastline with the gulf of mexico 15 natural geography edit pico de orizaba the natural geography can be categoried into nine regions the sierra de zongolica the tecolutla region the huayacocotla region the metlac river area the tuxtlas region the central region the laguna del castillo region the pueblo viejo-tamiahua region and the laguna de alvarado region 13 the topography changes drastically rising from the narrow coastal plains to the highlands of the eastern sierra madre elevation varies from sea level to the pico de orizaba mexico’s highest peak at 5,636 m 18,491 ft above sea level 12 15 the coast consists of low sandy strips interspersed with tidewater streams and lagoons 14 most of the long coastline is narrow and sandy with unstable dunes small shifting lagoons and points 13 the mountains are of the sierra madre oriental and the trans-mexican volcanic belt mountain ranges include the sierra de topila sierra de otontepec sierra de huayacocotla sierra de coxquihui sierra de chiconquiaco sierra de jalacingo sierra de axocuapan sierra de huatusco sierra de zongolica and the sierra de los tuxtla major peaks include pico de orizaba

covered in snow year round the cofre de perote is covered in winter major valleys include the acultzingo córdoba maltrata orizaba and san andrés 13 jamapa river more than 40 rivers and tributaries provide water for irrigation and hydroelectric power they also carry rich silt down from the eroding highlands which is deposited in the valleys and coastal areas 14 all of the rivers and streams that cross the state begin in the sierra madre oriental or in the central mesa flowing east to the gulf of mexico the important ones include actopan river acuatempan river río blanco cazones river coatzacoalcos river río de la antigua hueyapan river jamapa river nautla river pánuco river papaloapan river tecolutla river tonalá river tuxpan river and xoloapa river the largest in terms of water discharge are the pánuco tuxpan papaloapan coazocoalcos and uxpanapa the panuco tuxpan papaloapan and coatzacoalcos are navigable 13 two of mexico s most polluted rivers the coatzacoalcos and the río blanco are located in the state much of the pollution comes from industrial sources but the discharge of sewerage and uncontrolled garbage disposal are also major contributors the state has very few sewage treatment plants with only 10 of sewage being treated before discharge 16 the state also has ten major waterfalls and ten major coastal lagoons there is only one significant lake called lake catemaco off the coast are the islands of isla de lobos isla de los burros isla de sacrificios isla de salmendina isla del idolo isladel toro isla frijoles isla juan a ramirez isla pajaros and isla terrón and the ocean reefs called blanquilla medio tangüillo tuxpan gualleguilla gallega anegada de adento anegada de afuera and cabezo 13 climate edit mountain formation in the south of the state

cold 12 hot and humid and hot and semi-humid climates dominate from sea level to about 1,000 m 3,280.8 ft above sea level average annual temperature ranges from 22 to 26c with precipitation varying from 2,000 mm 78.7 in to just over 3,500 mm 137.8 in per year cooler and humid climates are found at elevations between 1,000 m 3,280.8 ft and 1,600 m 5,249.3 ft  these have an average temperature of between 18 and 22c with precipitation varying between 2,000 mm 78.7 in and 2,500 mm 98.4 in  temperate climates are found at higher altitudes between 1,600 m 5,249.3 ft and 2,800 m 9,186.4 ft  temperatures here vary from 12 to 18c with precipitation varying more between 500 mm 19.7 in and 2,500 mm 98.4 in  cold climates are found at the highest elevations reaching up to the cofre de perote and the pico de orizaba there is a small semi arid region around the city of perote and the west of the huasteca area this is due to a rain shadow caused by the trans-mexican volcanic belt and the sierra madre oriental which do not permit the flow of moist gulf air to this region 13 ecosystems edit shore of lake catemaco various types of forest cover the state but evergreen tropical forest dominate 13 the state’s ecoregion is of great importance for many plant and animal species it is a center of plant endemism and has two separate endemic bird areas 17 the northern part of the state as well as the higher mountain areas are convergence zones between lowland evergreen tropical forests and more temperate flora and fauna it is also the northernmost occurrence of subhumid tropical forest in mexico although little of this remains mostly on steep slopes this tropical forest is situated in the northeastern coastal plain and extends into southern tamaulipas state on the east side of the sierra madre oriental the soils here are volcanic and shallow but with rich organic matter species that predominate include mayan breadnut brosimum alicastrum  sapodilla manilkara zapota  rosadillo celtis monoica  bursera simaruba dendropanax arboreus and sideroxylon capiri this ecoregion extends into the central part of the state with vegetation changing to include mahogany swietenia macrophylla  sapodilla manilkara zapota  bernoullia flammea and astronium graveolens  17 veracruz has been described as having one of the richest varieties of wildlife in the western hemisphere there is an especially diverse array of endemic insects like the conspicuous arsenura armida as well as insects the state is known for its many arachnids and features over 25 species of tarantula theraphosidae  of which many are endemic the state is part of birdlife international’s endemic bird area eba project due to the number of endemic birds here some of these include green-cheeked amazon amazona viridigenalis  tamaulipas crow corvus imparatus  altamira yellowthroat geothlypis flavovelata and crimson-collared grosbeak rhodothraupis celaeno  despite much of the deterioration of the forest areas it is still an important stopover for migratory birds as well many endangered mammal species can be found here including two endemic rodents peromyscus ochraventer neotoma angustapalata  the jaguar panthera onca  ocelot leopardus pardalis  jaguarundi herpailurus yaguarondi and coati nasua narica  17 the endangered baird s tapir may occasionally be spotted in the state s southern jungle regions such as biósfera los tuxtlas this region is also the northernmost extent of the primate alouatta palliata or mantled howler most of veracruz’s native forests have been destroyed and replaced by scrub and secondary communities of trees from 1900 to 1987, over 18,553 km2 7,163.4 sq mi of forest had been logged resulting in the loss of habitat and biodiversity much of the logging is due to commercial timber search for tropical hardwoods and the clearing of land for local farmers especially for cattle grazing only 20 of veracruz’s original ecosystem remains with 64 transformed by human exploitation despite some efforts at conservation and reclamation exploitation continues to put pressure on remaining wild areas 17 bougainvillea the state has 31 environmentally protected areas in 21 different municipalities nine are urban parks three are national parks pico de orizaba cofre de perote and san josé de los molinos  13 the cofre de perote national park is 11,700 hectares of pine and oyamel forest which was created in 1937. the los tuxtlas biosphere reserve covers the municipalities of ángel r cabada santiago tuxtla san andres tuxtla catemaco soteapan mecayapan pajapan and tatahuicapan for a total of 155,122 ha 383,314.8 acres  it contains various volcanos such as san martín and santa marta and rich biodiversity as it stretches from sea level to higher elevations with 16 climate regions groups into four climate types forest types range from evergreen tropical rainforest to pine 75 of species here are also found in central america and there is a total of 2,368 plant species some such as costus dirzoi daphnopsis megacarpa eugenia sotoesparzae inga sinacae miconia ibarrae mormodes tuxtlensis and thelypteris rachyflexuosa are native only to this area wildlife includes 102 mammal species 49 amphibian 109 reptilian 561 bird species and more species in danger of extinction include the jaguar spider monkey and anteater  13 the veracruz reef system is also considered to be a national park and is mostly off the coast of veracruz city boca del río and alvarado the area includes coral reefs seaweed beds and other marine vegetation covering an area of 52,239 ha 129,085.4 acres  there are seventeen reefs in total some of which jut above the surface to form small islands this system links with the reef systems of campeche and yucatán  13 history edit pre-columbian edit olmec stone head the history of the native peoples of the state of veracruz is complex in the pre-columbian period the modern-day state of veracruz was inhabited primarily by four indigenous cultures the huastecs and otomis occupied the north while the totonacs resided in the north-center the olmecs one of the oldest cultures in the americas became dominant in the southern part of veracruz 15 remains of these past civilizations can be found in archeological sites such as pánuco castillo de teayo el zapotal las higueras quiahuiztlán el tajín cempoala tres zapotes and san lorenzo tenochtitlán  18 the first major civilization in the territory of the current state was that of the olmecs the olmecs lived in the coatzacoalcos river region and it became the center of olmec culture the main ceremonial center here was san lorenzo tenochtitlán other major centers in the state include tres zapotes in the city of veracruz and la venta in tabasco the culture reached its height about 2600 years ago with its best-known artistic expression being the colossal stone heads 18 these ceremonial sites were the most complex of that early time period for this reason many anthropologists consider the olmec civilization to be the mother culture of the many mesoamerican cultures that followed it by 300 bce this culture was eclipsed by other emerging civilizations in mesoamerica 15 another major group was the totonacs who have survived to the present day their region called totonacapan is centered between the cazones river and the papaloapan river in the north of the state pre-columbian totonacs lived from hunting fishing and agriculture mostly of corn beans chili peppers and squash this is also the native region of the vanilla bean clay sculptures with smiling faces are indicative of this culture the major site is el tajín located near papantla but the culture reached its apogee in cempoala about five miles 8 km inland from the current port of veracruz  when it was conquered by the aztecs 18 when the spaniards arrived in 1519, the territory was still home to a population of about 250,000 people living in fifty population centers and speaking four totonac dialects 25,000 were living in cempoala alone 15 the huastecs are in the far north of the veracruz and extend into parts of tamaulipas hidalgo san luis potosí querétaro and puebla the language and agricultural techniques of these people and the maya are similar however only a few buildings and ceramics remain from the early huastec culture this culture also reached its peak between 1200 and 1519, when it was conquered by the spanish 18 during the 15th and very early 16th century the aztecs came to dominate much of the state and dividing it into tributary provinces of tochtepec cuetlaxtlan cempoallan quauhtochco jalapa misantla and tlatlauhquitepec the aztecs were interested in the area s vegetation and crops such as cedars fruit cotton cacao corn beans and vanilla however the totonacs chafed under aztec rule with aztec rulers from axayacatl to moctezuma ii having to send soldiers to quell rebellions the huastecs were subjugated more successfully by the aztecs and relegated to the provinces of atlan and tochpan 15 colonial period 1519–1821 edit playa villa rica where the spanish built the first city of veracruz veracruz played an important part in the spanish conquest of the aztec empire by hernán cortés and his expedition members they founded villa rica de la vera cruz on may 18, 1519, as the first spanish town in what is now mexico by doing so cortés threw off the authority of the governor of cuba diego veláquez and took authority from the town council cabildo of veracruz and claim authority directly from the spanish crown a small contingent of the expedition remained at veracruz while the main body of conquerors moved inland 19 the totonacs were the first people with whom the spanish had contact on the american mainland 15 the very first contact was with captain juan de grijalva on the coastline north of the present-day city of veracruz 18 still chafing under aztec rule totonac ruler tlacochcalcatl welcomed hernán cortés and promised 50,000 warriors to help defeat tenochtitlan the spanish helped the totonacs expel aztec tribute collectors and to seize control of some aztec outposts 15 the spanish founded the port city of veracruz on the coast as the first municipality under the direct control of the king of spain cortés then began his march inland to tenochtitlan 18 during the conquest the rest of the totonac peoples allied themselves with the spanish but the huastecs despite also being under aztec rule fought against them after the fall of tenochtitlan cortés sent a regiment to subdue the huastecs 15 during the early conquest era cortés distributed the labor of indigenous settlements to particular conquerors in an institution known as encomienda the indigenous ruler of the settlement was charged with mobilization labor and tribute that was due the holder of the encomienda veracruz had a number of encomiendas that changed hands a number of times but early on came under the direct control of the spanish crown rather than individual encomenderos 20 during the colonial era veracruz was the main port of entry for immigrants from spain african slaves and all types of luxury goods for import and export the first group of franciscans arrived in veracruz in 1524, walking barefoot to the capital of the spanish colony of new spain 21 the route between veracruz and the spanish capital of mexico city built on the site of the aztec capital tenochtitlan was the key trade route during the colonial era much of the history of the state is involved with the port city that cortés founded in 1519. veracruz became the principal and often only port to export and import goods between the colony of new spain and spain itself 15 to ensure the port’s monopoly it came to have control over almost all of new spain s gulf coastline 18 new spain s silver and cochineal red dye were the two most important exports from the port along with chocolate vanilla chili peppers and much more were exported imported were livestock sheep cows goats horses  wheat and other cultivars from the caribbean slaves pineapple and sugar cane were introduced this made the port a highly prized target for pirates during the colonial period with attacks and sackings frequent 11 15 this led to the building of the fort of san juan de ulúa and the fortification of the city overall 18 much of totonac and huastec culture have survived the colonial period into the present day much of the reason for this is that the north of veracruz is rugged with thick vegetation and relatively little of the resources the spanish were looking for 15 veracruz is considered to be where the mestizo or mixed european indigenous race began which is a large part of mexican cultural identity 18 statue of rebel leader yanga though the spaniards had halted the azrtec wars and human sacrifices an unexpected problem arose european diseases decimated the native population of the province prompting the importation of african slaves during the colonial period starting in the 16th century the spanish imported between 500,000–1,000,000 west african slaves into mexico between 1535 and 1767 miscegenation between indigenous and african population began almost immediately  new spain did not have any laws prohibiting interracial marriage hence the correct term is afro-mestizo which includes all 3 races indigenous african and spanish runaway slaves cimarrones became problematic to public order since they frequently formed robber bands that attacked travelers on highways crown efforts against these groups began in earnest in the late sixteenth century but a major rebellion broke out in 1606 in the areas of villa rica nueva veracruz antón lizardo and the rio blanco area however the gravest of these occurred in the orizaba area where there were about 500 fugitive slaves in 1609, a leader named gaspar yanga led an insurrection against the spanish but was defeated in battle unrest continued eventually forcing the government to sign an amnesty pact and giving the africans the right to form their own community exacting as a condition that bandits be suppressed this was called san lorenzo de zerral but today it is known as the municipality of yanga this was the first time slavery was abolished in the americas 18 in the first half of the seventeenth century cities such as córdoba orizaba and xalapa were formed or expanded to protect the trade route between mexico city and the port of veracruz during this time the spanish and mixed-race population increased as the purely indigenous population continued to fall to a fraction of pre-conquest levels due now to mixing rather than disease  almost all trade in and out of new spain had to be with spain except for some limited trade authorized with england and other spanish colonies this would stay in place until 1778, when the decreto de libre comercio allowing a limited free trade within spanish-held realms lifted many of these restrictions on trade with europe this would make the port more important than it had been and led to increased prosperity for the inhabitants outside of the port in other areas of the province the economy was based on agriculture livestock and commerce in 1720, xalapa organized the first trade fair making it the center for trade between inland mexican goods and those from abroad this would lead to its eventual status as capital of the state 18 in 1746, the state was divided into the civil jurisdictions of pánuco tampico huayacocotla huauchinango papantla misantla xalapa jalacingo veracruz córdoba orizaba cosamaloapan tuxtla and cotaxtla 18 the port city of veracruz and the fort of san juan de ulúa where cortés landed three hundred years earlier was where the loyalist soldiers of the spanish crown made their last stand against the independence movement in 1824. 15 independence edit depiction of the battle of veracruz during the mexican–american war during the mexican war of independence there was support for the insurgents in many parts of the state with skirmishes erupting in various parts as early as 1811. a major conspiracy against the colonial government was discovered in the port in 1812, with rebels taking ayahualulco and ixhuacán during the same year this forced royalist troops to withdraw to xalapa eventually this city along with the port were cut off from mexico city most of the state remained in rebel hands during the rest of the war although the commercial class of the port did not support the effort in 1821, juan de o donojú the last viceroy of new spain came to the port to leave for spain however until 1823, spanish troops continued to occupy san juan de ulúa fort in 1826, the city would receive the first of its four titles of heroic city for confronting these remaining spanish troops 18 while the last of the spanish held on in san juan de ulúa agustín de iturbide had been declared the emperor of mexico in 1822. however his reign quickly encountered resistance from those favoring a republican form of government including from antonio lópez de santa anna from his stronghold in veracruz state months later iturbide would go into exile and santa anna would eventually hold nine terms as president 15 18 the french intervened in mexico through veracruz for the first time in the 1838, in what became the pastry war the port was blockaded efforts to defend the country were coordinated from xalapa the port was bombarded but eventually a settlement was reached 18 during the mexican–american war the port was blockaded again this time by the americans initial american attempts in 1847 to land in alvarado were checked but the americans then made a plan to land a few miles south of veracruz which surrendered after a 20-day siege defeated general santa anna s forces at the battle of cerro gordo and marched inland through xalapa towards mexico city led by general winfield scott  15 18 mexico surrendered shortly after the municipalities of tuxpan and chicontepec belonged to puebla until 1853, when they were annexed to veracruz to give the state its final form in 1855, the state government palace was constructed during the reform war the major player was ignacio de la llave whose name is part of the state s official designation in 1858, the port became the site for the liberal government under benito juárez after he was forced out of mexico city during the reform war their control of this port and its customs duties allowed liberal forces to gather resources conservative forces attacked the state but were repelled from both the port and xalapa 18 the reform war wrecked mexico s economy and it found itself unable to pay debts it owed to europe as a result juárez cancelled mexico s foreign debt spain britain and france all outraged by this action decided in october 1861 to force repayment of their loans by the occupation of the mexican gulf coast normally this move would have been blocked by the united states under the monroe doctrine however that nation was occupied with a civil war at the time and the european powers believed that the americans could not act in december spanish troops commanded by general manuel gasset occupied the port of veracruz without any local resistance 22 followed a month later by french and british forces the spanish and the british withdrew after making deals with juárez but the french pushed on to establish the reign of maximilian i of mexico however this was short-lived and the french were expelled through veracruz in 1866 67. 15 in 1863, the state was officially named veracruz-llave after the french were expelled the state government was in the port of veracruz in 1878, the capital was transferred to orizaba it was later moved to xalapa in 1885. 18 by the end of the century many infrastructure improvements such as roads and railways especially the ferrocarril interoceánico had been completed with the major cities being veracruz orizaba xalapa córdoba jalacingo chicontepec and tantoyuca the discovery of oil in the north of the state attracted foreign firms which brought machinery needed for its extraction these companies included huasteca company petroleum and el aguila along with american and english firms during the same time period uprisings against the government under porfirio díaz in the agricultural south of the state were brutally repressed 18 20th century to the present edit unrest against the díaz regime continued until the outbreak of the mexican revolution ousted him from power the major event leading up to this war in veracruz was the cigar-makers strike of 1905, when more than 5,000 workers of the el valle nacional company walked off the job the governor teodora a dehesa unsuccessfully tried to negotiate a settlement the strike went on for months until the strikers won this victory encouraged more actions until strikes at the factories in rio blanco nogales santa rosa and contón de orizaba resulted in dramatic violence in january 1907. 18 no major battles of the mexican revolution were fought in the state though there were skirmishes and attacks on the port by 1914 rebel cándido agular occupied a number of municipalities in the state and in 1917, venustiano carranza transferred the federal government here temporarily 18 on april 21, 1914 an incident involving u.s sailors in tampico led president woodrow wilson to land american troops in veracruz where they remained for six months mexico later responded by severing diplomatic relations 15 after the revolution agrarian reform including the redistribution of land and the creation of ejidos took place here the oil companies in the north of the state were nationalized and consolidated into pemex in the 1930s by lázaro cárdenas in the 1950s more road construction such as the mexico city- poza rica veracruz-alvarado- coatzacoalco and tinajas-ciudad aleman-tlacoatalpan highways were constructed the universidad veracruzana was expanded as well in 1960, the museum of anthropology in xalapa was inaugurated as well as the coatzacoalco-salina cruz highway the veracruz city international airport was opened in the 1970s 18 economy edit veracruz has one of mexico’s leading economies based on agriculture and petroleum 14 using relatively recent night light data and electricity consumption in comparison with gross county product the informal sector of the local economy in veracruz state is shown to have grown during the period of the fox administration though the regional government remained pri the assumption that the informal economy of mexico is a constant 30 of total economic activity is not supported at the local level the small amount of local spatial autocorrelation that was found suggests a few clusters of high and low literacy rates amongst municipios in veracruz but not enough to warrant including an i-statistic as a regressor global spatial autocorrelation is found especially literacy at the macro-regional level which is an area for further research beyond this study improved literacy bolsters both the informal and formal economies in veracruz indicating policies designed to further literacy are vital for growing the regional economy while indigenous people are relatively poor little evidence was found that the informal economy is a higher percentage of total economic activity in a municipio with a high share of indigenous people while the formal economy might have been expanding relative to the informal economy in 2000, by 2006 this process had been reversed with growing informality while rural municipios have smaller economies they are not different than urban municipios in the share of the economy that is informal programs in the past that might move economic activity from the informal to the formal sector have not succeeded suggesting public finance issues such as tax evasion will continue to plague the state with low government revenues 23 agriculture edit vanilla beans the primary sector of the economy agriculture forestry and fishing has been important since pre-hispanic times and continues to be important both as a source of income as well as culturally the state has abundant rainfall and extremely fertile soils as well as a long coastline and forest containing a wide variety of trees and other plants 15 24 there is about 1 million hectares of cultivable land half of which is in private hands and 43 is ejido or communal land the rest is occupied by human settlements there are 3,620 ejidos parceled out to 270,000 ejido members 52.5 of agricultural land is used for the growing of crops or used as pasture and 43.1 is forest or rainforest chief agricultural products include coffee vanilla sugarcane tobacco bananas coconuts and
