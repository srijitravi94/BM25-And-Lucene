usenet bulletin board system and downloadable software 11 the information collected by these crawlers does not include all the information available on the internet since much of the data is restricted by the publisher or stored in databases that are not accessible to overcome inconsistencies in partially cached websites archive-it.org was developed in 2005 by the internet archive as a means of allowing institutions and content creators to voluntarily harvest and preserve collections of digital content and create digital archives 12 crawl are contributed from various sources some imported from third parties and others generated internally by the archive 6 for example crawls are contributed by the sloan foundation and alexa crawls run by ia on behalf of nara and the internet

university of california berkeley in 2002, which gives a website owner the right block access to the site s archives 41 wayback has complied with this policy to help avoid expensive litigation 42 the wayback retroactive exclusion policy began to relax in 2017, when it stopped honoring robots.txt on u.s government and military web sites for both crawling and displaying web pages as of april 2017,

needed in legal evidence edit civil litigation edit netbula llc v chordiant software inc edit in a 2009 case netbula llc v chordiant software inc. defendant chordiant filed a motion to compel netbula to disable the robots.txt file on its website that was causing the wayback machine to retroactively remove access to previous versions of pages it had archived from netbula s site pages that chordiant believed would support its case 52 netbula objected to the motion on the ground that defendants were asking to alter netbula s website and that they should have subpoenaed internet archive for the pages directly 53 an employee of internet archive filed a sworn statement supporting chordiant s motion however stating that it could not produce the web pages by any other means without considerable burden expense and disruption to its operations 52 magistrate judge howard lloyd in the northern district of california san jose division rejected netbula s arguments and ordered them to disable the

content of telewizja polska s website telewizja polska brought a motion in limine to suppress the snapshots on the grounds of hearsay and unauthenticated source but magistrate judge arlander keys

evidence judge guzman reasoned that the employee s affidavit contained both hearsay and inconclusive supporting statements and the purported web page printouts were not self-authenticating citation needed patent law edit main article internet as a source of prior art provided some additional requirements are met e.g. providing an authoritative statement of the archivist  the united states patent office and the european patent office will accept date stamps from the internet archive as evidence of when a given web page was accessible to the public these dates are used to determine if a web page is available as prior art for instance in examining a patent application 56 limitations of utility edit there are technical limitations to archiving a website and as a consequence it is possible for opposing parties in litigation to misuse the results provided by website archives this problem can be exacerbated by the practice of submitting screen shots of web pages in complaints answers or expert witness reports when the underlying links are not exposed and therefore can contain errors for example archives such as the wayback machine do not fill out forms and therefore do not include the contents of non-restful e-commerce databases in their archives 57 legal status edit in europe the wayback machine could be interpreted as violating copyright laws only the content creator can decide where their content is published or duplicated so the archive would have to delete pages from its system upon request of the creator 58 the exclusion policies for the wayback machine may be

the internet archive accusing the organization of copyright infringement as well as violations of the dmca and the computer fraud and abuse act healthcare advocates claimed that since they had installed a robots.txt file on their website even if after the initial lawsuit was filed the archive should have removed all previous copies of the plaintiff website from the wayback machine however some material continued to be publicly visible on wayback 63 the lawsuit was settled out of court after wayback fixed the problem 64 suzanne shell edit in december 2005, activist suzanne shell filed suit demanding internet archive pay her us 100,000 for archiving her website profane-justice.org between 1999 and 2004. 65 66 internet archive filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the northern district of california on january 20, 2006, seeking a judicial determination that internet archive did not violate shell s copyright shell responded and brought a

including materials in the wayback machine of persons who do not wish to have their web content archived we recognize that ms shell has a valid and enforceable copyright in her web site and we regret

natural disasters 77 destruction remote or physical  citation needed manipulation of the archive s contents see also cyberattack backup  problematic copyright laws 78 and surveillance of the site s users 79 kevin vaughan suspects that in the long-term of multiple generations next to nothing will survive in a useful way besides if we have continuity in our technological civilization by which a lot of the bare data will remain findable and searchable  80 some find the internet archive which describes itself to be built for the long-term 81 to be working furiously to capture data before it disappears without any long-term infrastructure to speak of 82
