valvetrain ioe dimensions dry weight 470 lb 213 kg chronology predecessor willys go-devil willys lightning successor jeep tornado engine the willys f4-134 hurricane was an inline-4 piston engine and powered the famous jeep cj in the cj-3b cj-5 and cj-6 models it was also used in the willys 473 and 475 pickups wagons and sedan deliveries it replaced the willys go devil engine that was used in the mb jeep and other early jeep-based models like the jeepster this engine was also built by mitsubishi for their license-built jeep as well as other applications design edit the hurricane was based on the earlier go-devil flathead engine to get more power from the engine the induction system was changed from the go-devil s side-valve configuration to an inlet-over-exhaust configuration or f-head  this allowed the valves to be larger and the combustion chamber to be smaller improving flow and increasing the compression ratio 2 the compression ratio rose from 6.5 1 in the go-devil engine to 7.5 1 in the hurricane engine although a version of the hurricane engine was made with a 6.9 1 compression ratio 3 f134 edit the l134 go devil was updated with the f-head to become the f134 in 1950. 4 5 this engine produced a gross output of 75 hp 56 kw 76 ps at 4000 rpm and 114 lb·ft 155 n·m of torque at 2000 rpm with a 7.5 1 compression ratio the gross power and torque outputs fell to 72 hp 54 kw 73 ps and 112 lb·ft 152 n·m respectively when the engine had a 6.9 1 compression ratio bore and stroke dimensions were the same as the l-head engine at 3 1⁄8 x 4 3⁄8 giving 134.2 cu in 2,199 cc  3 the f4-134 was introduced in 1950 in the jeep truck 4 vehicles with this engine were given the model designation 4-73 6 this engine was not placed in a cj until the introduction of the cj-3b in 1953, which had a distinctive high hood to accommodate the much taller engine 2 the engine remained in production until 1971, after american motors corporation amc purchased kaiser jeep applications

jeepster commando f161 edit the f6-161 hurricane is an f-head version of the l6-161 lightning flathead straight six it was used in the model 685 station wagon 7 bf-161 the bf-161 has a 3 1⁄8 inch bore and a 3 1⁄2 inch stroke a one-barrel carburetor and an output of 90 hp 67 kw 91 ps at 4400 rpm and 135 lb·ft 183 n·m of torque at 2000 rpm its 161.1 cu in 2,640 cc displacement features a compression ratio of 7.6 1. 8 2600 the 2600 was essentially the same bf-161 engine made in brazil by willys-overland s subsidiary but it had two one-barrel carburetors simultaneously opened and had an output of 130 hp 97 kw 132 ps at 4400 rpm and 140 lb·ft 190 n·m of torque at 2000 rpm the compression ratio remained 7.6 1. 8 3000 the 3-liter version is almost identical to the bf-161 engine with the stroke increased to 4 inches 100 mm giving it a displacement of 3,016 cc 184.0 cu in  8 with a 2-barrel carburetor it produced 140 hp 104 kw 142 ps at 4400 rpm and 161 lb·ft 218 n·m of torque at 2000 rpm it also had a slightly higher compression ratio of 8 1. 8 it initially used a different head with removable intake manifold later after ford acquired willys-overland do brasil they reverted the engine to its former head design with integral intake manifold improved cooling between cylinders 5 and 6 and installed a side-mounted oil filter instead of the front-mounted hose connected arrangement used by willys applications 1961–1962 willys aero 1963–1971 willys aero 2600 1960-1974 willys-overland jeep and rural willys 1968–1971 willys itamaraty 3000 1972-1974 ford maverick six-cylinder version in brazil super hurricane edit super hurricane engine in 1955 jeep willys utility wagon the 6-226 super hurricane 9 was a l-head 6-cylinder 10 11 from continental 11 with a bore of 3 5⁄16 inches and stroke of 4 3⁄8 inches giving a displacement of 226.2 cu in 3,707 cc  12 horsepower rating is 105 hp 78 kw 106 ps at 3600 rpm or 115 hp 86 kw 117 ps at 3650 rpm 12 as well as a torque rating of 190 lb·ft 258 n·m at 1400 rpm or at 1800 rpm 12 depending on the year of production mitsubishi versions edit mitsubishi built a version of the hurricane from 1954 as the jh4 69 hp  mostly for use in their license-built version of the jeep 13 they later developed a 61 ps 45 kw overhead-valve diesel version of the same called ke31 this was also turned into a 3.3 liter six-cylinder version with the same internal dimensions producing 85 ps 63 kw  which was named ke36 these diesel engines were used in the jeep but also in a number of light to medium-weight trucks and buses 14
