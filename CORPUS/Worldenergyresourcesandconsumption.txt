energy resources and worldwide energy supply this article needs to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information october 2014 the world s energy consumption 2015 data 1 total primary consumption in the world by fuel 2015  world energy consumption is the total energy used by the entire human civilization typically measured per year it involves all energy harnessed from every energy source applied towards humanity s endeavours across every single industrial and technological sector across every country it does not include energy from food and the extent to which direct biomass burning has been accounted for is poorly documented being the power source metric of civilization world energy consumption has deep implications for humanity s socio-economic-political sphere institutions such as the international energy agency iea  the u.s energy information administration eia  and the european environment agency record and publish energy data periodically improved data and understanding of world energy consumption may reveal systemic trends and patterns which could help frame current energy issues and encourage movement towards collectively useful solutions closely related to energy consumption is the concept of total primary energy supply tpes  which - on a global level - is the sum of energy production minus storage changes since changes of energy storage over the year are minor tpes values can be used as an estimator for energy consumption however tpes ignores conversion efficiency overstating forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency e.g coal gas and nuclear and understating forms already accounted for in converted forms e.g photovoltaic or hydroelectricity  the iea estimates that in 2013, total primary energy supply tpes was 1.575 × 1017 wh 157.5 pwh 5.67 × 1020 joules or 13,541 mtoe  2 from 2000–2012 coal was the source of energy with the largest growth the use of oil and natural gas also had considerable growth followed by hydropower and renewable energy renewable energy grew at a rate faster than any other time in history during this period the demand for nuclear energy decreased in part due to nuclear disasters e.g three mile island 1979, chernobyl 1986, and fukushima 2011  1 3 in 2011, expenditures on energy totalled over 6 trillion usd or about 10 of the world gross domestic

consumption because much of the energy that is acquired by humans is lost as other forms of energy during the process of its refinement into usable forms of energy and its transport from its initial place of supply to consumers for instance when oil is extracted from the ground it must be refined into gasoline so that it can be used in a car and transported over long distances to gas stations where it can be used by consumers world final energy consumption refers to the fraction of the world s primary energy that is used in its final form by humanity in 2014, world primary energy supply amounted to 155,481 terawatt-hour twh or 13,541 mtoe while the world final energy consumption was 109,613 twh or about 29.5 less than the total supply 9 world final energy consumption includes products as lubricants asphalt and petrochemicals which have chemical energy content but are not used as fuel this non-energy use amounted to 9,404 twh 809 mtoe in 2012. 11 by the end of 2014, the

was consumed in africa and 40 was consumed in the asia pacific region 1 recently there has been a large increase in international agreements and national energy action plans such as the eu 2009 renewable energy directive to increase the use of renewable energy due to the growing concerns about pollution from energy sources that come from fossil fuels such as oil coal and natural gas 3 14 one such initiative was the united nations development programme s world energy assessment in 2000 that highlighted many challenges humanity would have to overcome in order to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources 3 from 2000–2012 renewable energy grew at a rate higher than any other point in history with a consumption increase of 176.5 million tonnes of oil during this period oil coal and natural gas continued to grow and had increases that were much higher than the increase in renewable energy the following figures illustrate the growth in consumption of fossil fuels such as oil coal and natural gas as well as renewable sources of energy during this period 1 trends edit world primary energy consumption in quadrillion btu 15 energy intensity of different economies the graph shows the ratio between energy usage and gdp for selected countries gdp is based on 2004 purchasing power parity and 2000 dollars adjusted for inflation 16 gdp and energy consumption in japan 1958–2000 the data shows the correlation between gdp and energy use however it also shows that this link can be broken after the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 the energy use stagnated while japan s gdp continued to grow after 1985, under the influence of the then much cheaper oil energy use resumed its historical relation to gdp 17 the energy consumption growth in the g20 slowed down to 2 in 2011, after the strong increase of 2010. the economic crisis is largely responsible for this slow growth for several years now the world energy demand is characterized by the bullish chinese and indian markets while developed countries struggle with stagnant economies high oil prices resulting in stable or decreasing energy consumption 18 according to iea data from 1990 to 2008, the average energy use per person increased 10 while world population increased 27  regional energy use also grew from 1990 to 2008 the middle east increased by 170  china by 146  india by 91  africa by 70  latin america by 66  the usa by 20  the eu-27 block by 7  and world overall grew by 39  in 2008, total worldwide primary energy consumption was 132,000 terawatt-hours twh or 474 exajoules ej  19 in 2012, primary energy demand increased to 158,000 twh 567 ej  20 energy consumption in the g20 increased by more than 5 in 2010 after a slight decline of 2009. in 2009, world energy consumption decreased for the first time in 30 years by 1.1  or about 130 million tonnes of oil equivalent mtoe  as a result of the financial and economic crisis which reduced world gdp by 0.6 in 2009. 21 this evolution is the result of two contrasting trends energy consumption growth remained vigorous in several developing countries specifically in asia 4  conversely in oecd consumption was severely cut by 4.7 in 2009 and was thus almost down to its 2000 levels in north america europe and the cis consumptions shrank by 4.5  5 and 8.5 respectively due to the slowdown in economic activity china became the world s largest energy consumer 18 of the total since its consumption surged by 8 during 2009 up from 4 in 2008  oil remained the largest energy source 33 despite the fact that its share has been decreasing over time coal posted a growing role in the world s energy consumption in 2009, it accounted for 27 of the total most energy is used in the country of origin since it is cheaper to transport final products than raw materials in 2008, the share export of the total energy production by fuel was oil 50 1,952 3,941 mt  gas 25 800 3,149 bcm and hard coal 14 793 5,845 mt  22 most of the world s high energy resources are from the conversion of the sun s rays to other energy forms after being incident upon the planet some of that energy has been preserved as fossil energy some is directly or indirectly usable for example via solar pv thermal wind hydro- or wave power the total solar irradiance is measured by satellite to be roughly 1361 watts per square meter see solar constant  though it fluctuates by about 6.9 during the year due to the earth s varying distance from the sun this value after multiplication by the cross-sectional area intercepted by the earth is the total rate of solar energy received by the planet about half 89,000 tw reaches the earth s surface 23 the estimates of remaining non-renewable worldwide energy resources vary with the remaining fossil fuels totaling an estimated 0.4 yottajoule yj or 4 × 1023 joules and the available nuclear fuel such as uranium exceeding 2.5 yj fossil fuels range from 0.6 to 3 yj if estimates of reserves of methane clathrates are accurate and become technically extractable the total power flux from the sun intercepting the earth is 5.5 yj per year though not all of this is available for human consumption the iea estimates for the world to meet global energy demand for the two decades from 2015 to 2035 it will require investment of 48 trillion and credible policy frameworks 24 according to iea 2012 the goal of limiting warming to 2 °c is becoming more difficult and costly with each year that passes if action is not taken before 2017, co2 emissions would be locked-in by energy infrastructure existing in 2017. fossil fuels are dominant in the global energy mix supported by 523 billion subsidies in 2011, up almost 30 on 2010 and six times more than subsidies to renewables 25 regional energy use kwh capita twh and

problem efforts to resolve this include the kyoto protocol which is a un agreement aiming to reduce harmful climate impacts which a number of nations have signed limiting global temperature increase to 2 degrees celsius thought to be a risk by the sei is now doubtful to limit global temperature to a hypothetical 2 degrees celsius rise would demand a 75 decline in carbon emissions in industrial countries by 2050, if the population is 10 billion in 2050. 28 across 40 years this averages to a 2 decrease every year in 2011, the emissions of energy production continued rising regardless of the consensus of the basic problem hypothetically according to robert engelman worldwatch institute  in order to prevent collapse human civilization would have to stop increasing emissions within a decade regardless of the economy or population 2009  29 greenhouse gases are not the only emissions of energy production and consumption large amounts of pollutants such as sulphurous oxides sox  nitrous
