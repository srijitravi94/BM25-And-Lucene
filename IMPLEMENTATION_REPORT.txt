IMPLEMENTATION REPORT :

BM25 Algorithm has been implemented in the following steps:

1. A function to parse the CORPUS documents to find the Inverted Index.
2. A function to parse the Query document for ease of use.
3. A function to calculate the length of each document in the corpus.
4. A function to calculate the average length of documents.
5. A function to find the term frequencies in the queries.
6. A function to calculate the BM25 score given all the parameters.
7. A function to pass the query, calculate required parameters and find the score for each document.
8. A function to write the tOP 100 ranked documents to a file for each query.


Function 1: 
PARSE THE CORPUS TO FIND INVERTED INDEX

Collate all the words from all the documents, store the following two details:
1. All the documents that has this word.
2. Number of times this word has been repeated in each of this document.


Function 2:
PARSE THE QUERY DOCUMENT

Parse this document and convert it into a list of lists.


Function 3:
CALCULATE THE LENGTH OF EACH DOCUMENT

From the CORPUS folder, find the number of words each document has and store it in a dictionary.


Function 4:
CALCULATE THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF ALL THE DOCUMENTS

From the function 3 returned dictionary, extract all the file lengths and find their average.


Function 5:
CALCULATE FREQUENCIES OF THE TERMS IN QUERIES

Given a query, if a word is repeated, increase its frequencies and do so till end of terms in a query.
Store the same in a dictionary.


Function 6:
CALCULATE BM25 SCORE GIVEN THE REQUIRED PARAMETERS

Given the following paramters are required: (n, f, qf, r, N, dl, avdl), the following steps are done to find the BM25 score:

Step1: Calculate K as: K = k1 * ((1 - b) + b * (float(dl) / float(avdl)))
Step2: Calculate Quantity1 as : Q1 = log(((r + 0.5) / (R - r + 0.5)) / ((n - r + 0.5) / (N - n - R + r + 0.5)))
Step3: Calculate Quantity2 as : Q2 = ((k1 + 1) * f) / (K + f)
Step4: Calculate Quantity3 as : Q3 = ((k2 + 1) * qf) / (k2 + qf)
Step5: Calculate BM25score as : Q1 * Q2 * Q3


Function 7:
CALCULATE THE DOCUMENT SCORE FOR EACH QUERY BASED ON BM25 SCORE

Given each of the query, the necessary parameters for finding BM25 score are calculated by calling appropriate functions described above.


Function 8:
WRITE THE TOP 100 DOCUMENTS FOR EACH QUERY TO A FILE

The scored documents are sorted and the first 100 ranked documents are written to file. This step is repeated for all the queries in the query document.
CALCULATE BM25 SCORE FOR EACH OF THIS QUERY
